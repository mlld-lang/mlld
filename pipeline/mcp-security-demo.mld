>> ============================================================
>> STEP 1: Import MCP tools from fake server
>> ============================================================

>> Import specific tools from an MCP server.
>> The server spec is a command that speaks MCP protocol over stdio.
import tools { @echo, @ping } from mcp "node tests/support/mcp/fake-server.cjs"

log "Imported MCP tools: @echo, @ping"

>> ============================================================
>> STEP 2: Show automatic src:mcp taint on tool outputs
>> ============================================================

>> Call an MCP tool. The output automatically carries src:mcp taint.
>> This taint propagates through all transformations.
var @echoResult = @echo({ text: "hello from mcp" })
show @echoResult

>> Taint propagates through transformations
var @derived = `MCP said: @echoResult`
log "Derived value still carries MCP taint through interpolation"

>> Ping returns "pong" with src:mcp taint
var @pong = @ping({})
show @pong

>> ============================================================
>> STEP 3: Guard blocking secret data from flowing to MCP tools
>> ============================================================

>> Data-label guard fires when secret data flows through any operation.
>> Condition narrows to exe calls only, which includes MCP tool calls.
guard @noSecretToMcp for secret = when [
  @mx.op.type == "exe" => deny "Secret data cannot flow to executable operations"
  * => allow
]

>> Define a secret value
var secret @apiKey = "sk-12345-super-secret"

>> Safe call: no secrets involved
var @safeResult = @echo({ text: "public data" })
show @safeResult

>> Attempted call with secret data handled via denied handler.
>> The exe wraps the MCP call so the denial is caught gracefully.
exe @tryEchoSecret(value) = when [
  denied => `BLOCKED: @mx.guard.reason`
  * => @echo({ text: @value })
]

var @blockedResult = @tryEchoSecret(@apiKey)
show @blockedResult

>> ============================================================
>> STEP 4: Policy restricting MCP tool operations
>> ============================================================

>> Policy label flow rules restrict what MCP-tainted data can do.
>> src:mcp data is denied from destructive operations.
var @policyConfig = {
  labels: {
    "src:mcp": {
      deny: ["destructive", "op:cmd:rm"]
    }
  }
}
policy @p = union(@policyConfig)

log "Policy configured: src:mcp data denied from destructive ops and rm"

>> ============================================================
>> STEP 5: Audit trail via after-guard
>> ============================================================

>> After-guard runs after exe operations complete.
>> When the operation has src:mcp taint, it appends audit info to the output.
guard after @auditMcp for op:exe = when [
  @mx.taint.includes("src:mcp") => allow `@output [audited: @mx.op.name]`
  * => allow
]

>> Call MCP tool - the after-guard appends audit info
var @auditedResult = @echo({ text: "audited call" })
show @auditedResult

var @auditedPong = @ping({})
show @auditedPong

MCP Security Demo Complete
===========================

This demonstrated five MCP security scenarios:

1. IMPORT MCP TOOLS
   - import tools { @echo, @ping } from mcp "server-command"
   - Tools are callable as regular mlld functions

2. AUTOMATIC src:mcp TAINT
   - All MCP tool outputs carry src:mcp in their taint
   - Taint propagates through interpolation and transforms

3. GUARD BLOCKS SECRETS FROM MCP
   - guard for secret fires when secret-labeled data is used
   - Condition checks @mx.op.type == "exe" to target exe calls
   - Blocks secret data from flowing to any exe, including MCP tools

4. POLICY RESTRICTS MCP OPERATIONS
   - policy labels."src:mcp".deny blocks dangerous operations
   - MCP-tainted data cannot flow to destructive ops

5. AUDIT TRAIL VIA AFTER-GUARD
   - guard after for op:exe detects src:mcp taint
   - Appends audit info to output for provenance tracking

Guards use data-label filters (for secret) to catch labeled data flowing to operations.
MCP tool calls execute as exe operations, so for secret with @mx.op.type == "exe" catches them.
