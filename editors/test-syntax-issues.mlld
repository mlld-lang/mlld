# Test Syntax Highlighting Issues

## Testing Directive vs Variable Distinction

@import { * } from [@./main.mld]

@data codedirs = [@api, @cli, @core, @editors, @grammar, @interpreter @website]

@exec getfiles (dir, pattern) = @run [ls @dir/@pattern] this is invalid text

@data dirfiles = foreach @getfiles(@docs,"**/*.ts") << this is a comment after
@data dirfiles = foreach @getfiles(@docs,"**/*.ts") >> this is a comment after

@notadirective
>> this is a start line commeent
@text prompt = [[
Please review the following files:

{{files}}

Please provide a thorough, user-friendly documentation in Markdown for this file. Include sections, examples, and any important notes or edge cases.
]]

## Testing Each Issue:

1. **Directives should be different color from variables:**
   - `@import` = directive (should be keyword color)
   - `@data` = directive  
   - `@text` = directive
   - `@exec` = directive
   - `@notadirective` = variable (should be normal color)
   - `@api`, `@cli`, etc = variables

2. **Template interpolation `{{files}}` should be highlighted:**
   - See the `{{files}}` in the template above

3. **Reserved variable `@.` should be recognized:**
   - `@.` in the import line should be highlighted as reserved

4. **Both comment styles `>>` and `<<` should work:**
   - Both comment lines above should be highlighted as comments

5. **Only directive lines should have mlld syntax:**
   - The "this is invalid text" on the exec line should not be highlighted
   - Regular markdown paragraphs should use markdown highlighting
