# Security and Registry Documentation Consolidation Task

## Objective
Review and consolidate all security, registry, and module system documentation for the mlld project to create a comprehensive SECURITY-VISION.md document that clearly outlines:
1. The complete vision for security and module features
2. What has been implemented vs. what remains to be done
3. Open questions that need resolution
4. A clear roadmap forward

## Background Context
The mlld project has evolved organically with multiple design documents, implementation notes, and vision statements scattered across various directories. Some features have been implemented, others are partially complete, and some remain in the planning phase. Your task is to synthesize all this information into a coherent, actionable vision document.

## Key Goals for the Security System
Based on initial review, the high-level goals appear to be:
- Public and private modules with built-in and custom resolvers
- Project-level mlld.lock.json for URL content caching per TTL policies
- Global mlld.lock.json for system-wide security policies
- Gradual trust authorization system for commands and URLs
- GitHub-authenticated CLI for module publishing (already implemented)
- Complete escaping strategy (already implemented)

## Files to Review

### 1. Current Official Documentation (Known to be accurate)
These represent the current state of implementation:

### 2. Vision and Specification Documents
These contain the intended design and may be partially outdated:

- `/Users/adam/dev/mlld/_dev/specs/version-resolution-flow.md` - Version resolution design

### 3. Work Stream Documents (Partially implemented)
These track work that was planned/started:
- `/Users/adam/dev/mlld/_dev/workstreams/NOW/01-grammar-ttl-trust.md` - TTL/trust grammar work
- `/Users/adam/dev/mlld/_dev/workstreams/NOW/02-security-integration.md` - Security integration
- `/Users/adam/dev/mlld/_dev/workstreams/NOW/03-hash-cache-imports.md` - Hash cache implementation
- `/Users/adam/dev/mlld/_dev/workstreams/NOW/05-cli-commands.md` - CLI command implementation
- `/Users/adam/dev/mlld/_dev/workstreams/NOW/07-frontmatter-support.md` - Frontmatter implementation
- `/Users/adam/dev/mlld/_dev/workstreams/NOW/RECAP-UPDATES.md` - Status updates

### 4. Evolution Archive (Historical context)
Located in `/Users/adam/dev/mlld/_dev/archive/2025-05-evolution/`:
- `SECURITY.md` - Security overview
- `BASIC-SECURITY.md` - Basic security implementation
- `TTL-TRUST.md` - TTL and trust system design
- `TTL-TRUST-CHANGES-SUMMARY.md` - Summary of TTL/trust changes
- `HASH-CACHE.md` - Hash cache design
- `HASH-CACHE-*.md` - Various hash cache implementation details
- `REGISTRY-*.md` - Registry implementation phases
- `SECURITY-REGISTRY-*.md` - Security/registry integration
- `ADVISORY-REGISTRY-GOALS.md` - Advisory system goals

## Review Process

### Phase 1: Current State Assessment
1. Read all official documentation to understand what's implemented
2. Identify features that are documented as complete
3. Note any discrepancies between docs and mentioned implementation

### Phase 2: Vision Extraction
1. Read all vision/spec documents
2. Extract the complete intended feature set
3. Identify core principles and design decisions
4. Note any conflicting visions or approaches

### Phase 3: Implementation Status
1. Cross-reference vision with work stream documents
2. Identify what was started vs. completed
3. Extract any learnings or pivots from the work streams

### Phase 4: Synthesis
1. Create a unified vision that incorporates all valid ideas
2. Resolve any conflicts or contradictions
3. Identify gaps and open questions
4. Prioritize remaining work

## Output: SECURITY-VISION.md Structure

The consolidated document should include:

```markdown

## Review Guidelines

1. **Be Critical**: Don't assume all written plans are still valid
2. **Look for Patterns**: Identify recurring themes across documents
3. **Note Contradictions**: Highlight conflicting approaches
4. **Extract Principles**: Find the underlying philosophy
5. **Focus on Feasibility**: Consider implementation complexity
6. **User Perspective**: Always consider the end-user experience

## Questions to Answer

1. What is the complete vision for mlld's security model?
2. Which security features are fully implemented?
3. Which features are partially implemented and what remains?
4. What are the critical design decisions that need to be made?
5. Are there conflicting approaches that need resolution?
6. What is the logical order of implementation?
7. What are the dependencies between features?
8. How do all these systems work together?

## Notes for Review
- The lockfile-design-discussion.md is noted as "critical" - pay special attention
- Some features may have been implemented differently than originally planned
- The project uses GitHub infrastructure as a foundation
- Security should enable productivity, not hinder it
- The escaping system is complete and should inform other security decisions

Begin by reading the official documentation first to establish the current baseline, then work through the vision documents to understand intent, and finally review the work streams and archive to understand the evolution and current state.
