# Valid Array Patterns Test

## Setup

## Array with variables and function calls

Mixed array: ["Hello","12:00 PM"]
## Array with quoted strings

File names: ["file1.md","file2.md","path with spaces.txt"]
## Array with variable and function call with argument

Number and double: [21,42]
## Nested arrays with file paths (loads file contents)

File contents array: ["Content from test file 1","Content from test file 2"]
## Array with objects

Objects: [{"name":"Alice","age":30},{"name":"Bob","age":25}]
## Mixed types array

Mixed types: ["Hello",42,true,null,["nested","array"]]
