Variable 'author' is already imported from "fileA.mld" and cannot be imported again from "fileB.mld". Variables in mlld are immutable.

Did you mean to:
- Use import aliases: @import { author as authorA } from "fileA.mld" and @import { author as authorB } from "fileB.mld"?
- Import only one of these files?
- Remove the duplicate import?
