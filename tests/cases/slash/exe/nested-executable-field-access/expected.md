# Test Nested Executable Field Access

This test verifies that deeply nested executable functions can be accessed and called through object property chains.

## Setup nested executable structure

## Test 1 level deep
1 level:
Level 4 executed!

## Test 2 levels deep
2 levels:
Level 4 executed!

## Test 3 levels deep (like github.pr.review)
3 levels:
Level 4 executed!

## Test 4 levels deep
4 levels:
Level 4 executed!

## Test 5 levels deep
5 levels:
Level 4 executed!

## Test 6 levels deep
6 levels:
Level 5 executed!

## Test with parameters

With parameters:
Parameter received: Hello from deep nesting!

## Test mixed executable and data fields

Mixed access:
static value
Level 4 executed!

Level 5 executed!
