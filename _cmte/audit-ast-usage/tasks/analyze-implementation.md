# Goal: Analyze Implementation of {{ item.name }} for AST Changes

## Context
The AST structure has been simplified. Key changes:
1.  Removed `structured` property from nodes. Logic should now rely on the `values` array.
2.  Removed `command` property from nodes. Logic should now rely on the `raw` property or `values` array.
3.  The `values` array now holds parsed node structures (like `VariableReferenceNode`, `TextNode`, etc.) which were previously nested within `structured`.
4.  The `raw` property should consistently represent the raw string content relevant to the directive.

# Relevant Fixture (Specific to {{ item.name }})
{{ item.relevantFixtureContent }}

# Implementation File Content ({{ item.name }})
{{ item.implFileContent }}

## Analysis Request
1.  Carefully review the **Implementation File Content** provided above.
2.  Reference the **Relevant Fixture** and the **Context** section describing the AST changes.
3.  Identify *every specific line number or code block* in the implementation that interacts with AST node properties (`raw`, `values`, `command`, `structured`, or subtypes within `values`).
4.  For each identified location, determine if a change is needed to align with the new AST structure. Specifically check for:
    *   Usage of the removed `command` property.
    *   Usage of the removed `structured` property.
    *   Correct usage of the `raw` property.
    *   Correct usage and iteration/access of the `values` array and its contained nodes.
5.  Format your findings as a markdown list below, under a `### Findings` heading:
    *   `* [Line Number(s)]: [Brief Description of Change Needed]`
    *   If no changes are needed, state `* No changes needed.`
