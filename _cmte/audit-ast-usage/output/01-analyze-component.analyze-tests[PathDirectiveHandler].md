## Findings

After analyzing the test file for the PathDirectiveHandler, I've identified the following areas that need changes to align with the new AST structure:

1. **Line 82**: In `createMockProcessingContext`, the function uses `directiveNode: node` which passes the node directly. This appears compatible with the new structure.

2. **Line 94-95**: The node creation using `coreCreateDirectiveNode('path', { identifier, path: { raw: rawPathValue, structured: {} } })` needs review. The test is creating a minimal `structured` object, but it may need to be more complete according to the new AST structure.

3. **Line 124-131**: When creating a node with a structured path value, the test includes `interpolatedValue: []` which appears to be an attempt to match the expected structure. However, according to the new AST changes, the `value` array should hold parsed node structures. This may need to be updated to correctly represent the interpolated path segments.

4. **Line 133**: The test expects `resolveInContextSpy` to be called with `structuredPathValue.interpolatedValue`, which may no longer be the correct property. According to the new AST structure, it should be checking `value` array instead.

5. **Line 150**: Similar to other instances, the node creation with `coreCreateDirectiveNode('path', { identifier, path: { raw: rawPathValue, structured: {} } })` needs to ensure it's using the correct structure.

6. **Lines 186, 205, and 223**: All instances of node creation with `coreCreateDirectiveNode` should be reviewed to ensure they're creating nodes with the correct structure according to the new AST changes.

7. **Line 94-95 console.log statement**: This debugging statement prints the node object, which could be useful for verifying the structure is correct, but should probably be removed in the final code.

Overall, the test file appears to be in a transition state, where it's using a core factory function (`coreCreateDirectiveNode`) but may not be fully aligned with the new AST structure. The main issue appears to be with how path structures are represented and accessed, particularly around the `interpolatedValue` vs. `value` array.
