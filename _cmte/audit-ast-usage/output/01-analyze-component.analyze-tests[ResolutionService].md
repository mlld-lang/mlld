# Analysis of ResolutionService Test File

After reviewing the test file for ResolutionService against the AST structure changes, I've identified several areas that need updates to align with the new structure.

## Findings

1. **Lines 190-196**: Mock creation of VariableReferenceNode
   - The node has `fields: []` property which is correct
   - The node has `valueType` property which should be removed
   - The node is missing `children` array which should be added

2. **Lines 297-303**: Mock creation of VariableReferenceNode
   - The node has `fields: []` property which is correct
   - The node has `valueType` property which should be removed
   - The node is missing `children` array which should be added

3. **Lines 455-463**: Mock creation of VariableReferenceNode with fields
   - The node has `fields: [{ type: 'field', value: 'name' }]` which is correct
   - The node has `valueType` property which should be removed
   - The node is missing `children` array which should be added

4. **Lines 489-500**: Mock creation of VariableReferenceNode with nested fields
   - The node has multiple fields which is correct
   - The node has `valueType` property which should be removed
   - The node is missing `children` array which should be added

5. **Lines 509-518**: Mock creation of VariableReferenceNode for field access error test
   - The node has `fields: [{ type: 'field', value: 'nonexistent' }]` which is correct
   - The node has `valueType` property which should be removed
   - The node is missing `children` array which should be added

6. **Lines 531-540**: Mock creation of VariableReferenceNode for field access on primitives
   - The node has `fields: [{ type: 'field', value: 'length' }]` which is correct
   - The node has `valueType` property which should be removed
   - The node is missing `children` array which should be added

7. **Lines 558-570**: Mock creation of VariableReferenceNode for nested data resolution
   - The node has multiple fields which is correct
   - The node has `valueType` property which should be removed
   - The node is missing `children` array which should be added

8. **Lines 579-588**: Mock creation of VariableReferenceNode for field access error
   - The node has `fields: [ { type: 'field', value: 'profile' } ]` which is correct
   - The node has `valueType` property which should be removed
   - The node is missing `children` array which should be added

9. **Lines 653-657**: Mock creation of MeldNode array with TextNode and VariableReferenceNode
   - Both nodes have `location` property which is correct
   - The VariableReferenceNode has `valueType` property which should be removed
   - The VariableReferenceNode is missing `children` array which should be added

10. **Lines 673-677**: Mock creation of MeldNode array with TextNode and VariableReferenceNode
    - Both nodes have `location` property which is correct
    - The VariableReferenceNode has `valueType` property which should be removed
    - The VariableReferenceNode is missing `children` array which should be added

11. **Lines 689-699**: Mock parser implementation for VariableReferenceNode
    - The node has `valueType` property which should be removed
    - The node is missing `children` array which should be added

12. **Lines 723-733**: Mock parser implementation for VariableReferenceNode
    - The node has `valueType` property which should be removed
    - The node is missing `children` array which should be added

13. **Lines 829-833**: Mock creation of VariableReferenceNode for content resolution
    - The node has `valueType` property which should be removed
    - The node is missing `children` array which should be added

14. **Lines 848-853**: Mock creation of VariableReferenceNode for content resolution
    - The node has `valueType` property which should be removed
    - The node is missing `children` array which should be added

15. **Lines 881-889**: Mock creation of VariableReferenceNode for error testing
    - The node has `valueType` property which should be removed
    - The node is missing `children` array which should be added

All identified instances need to:
1. Remove the `valueType` property
2. Add a `children` array (even if empty)
3. Ensure the `content` property correctly represents the raw string content for relevant nodes
