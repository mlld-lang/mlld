Based on the information provided, I need to analyze a test file for define directive handler, but the actual test file content was not provided in the `<TestFileContentDefinedirectivehandler>` section. I only have the relevant fixture file which shows the expected test cases.

## Findings

The test file content is missing or empty. I cannot perform a complete analysis without seeing the actual test implementation that needs to be checked against the AST changes.

From the fixture file I can see that tests would need to handle the following AST structures:
- Directive nodes with define directive kind
- Command subtypes (specifically runCommand)
- Text nodes within values array

But without seeing the actual test implementation, I cannot identify specific lines that need changes to align with the new AST structure.
