I'll analyze the PathDirectiveHandler implementation to identify areas that need changes based on the AST structure simplification.

## Findings

After analyzing the PathDirectiveHandler implementation, I've identified the following areas that interact with AST node properties and may need updates:

1. **Lines 51-52**: The code accesses `node` as `context.directiveNode` and casts it to `DirectiveNode`. This looks correct as it's working with the directive node directly.

2. **Lines 80-84**: The code checks `node.directive` and its kind property:
   ```javascript
   if (!node.directive || node.directive.kind !== 'path') {
       throw new DirectiveError('Invalid node type provided to PathDirectiveHandler', this.kind, DirectiveErrorCode.VALIDATION_FAILED, errorDetails);
   }
   const directive = node.directive as PathDirectiveData; 
   ```
   This appears to be using the old AST structure where directive data was nested in a `directive` property. According to the new structure, the directive data should be directly available in the node or accessed through the `children` array.

3. **Lines 85-86**: The code extracts directive properties:
   ```javascript
   const identifier = directive.identifier;
   const pathObject = directive.path;
   ```
   These properties might now be directly on the node or need to be accessed differently through the `children` array.

4. **Lines 92-93**: Accessing path properties:
   ```javascript
   const valueToResolve = pathObject.interpolatedValue ?? pathObject.raw;
   ```
   According to the new structure, `raw` should be used consistently for the raw string content, so this might need adjustment.

5. **Line 103**: Reference to `pathObject` which may need to be restructured.

The implementation will need updates to align with the new AST structure, particularly around how it accesses directive data and path information. The changes should focus on:
1. Removing references to the `directive` property
2. Properly accessing data from the `children` array
3. Using the `raw` property consistently for raw string content
4. Ensuring correct access to parsed node structures in the `children` array
