I'll analyze the implementation of the EmbedDirectiveHandler to identify any code that needs to be updated based on the AST structure changes described in the context.

## Findings

After carefully reviewing the implementation file and comparing it with the fixture and context information, I've identified the following areas that need attention:

1. **Line 157-158**: In the error handling, there's a check for `node.directive` which is still valid, but we should ensure we're accessing the directive properties correctly throughout the handler.

2. **Lines 180-181**: The code is accessing `directiveData.path as AstStructuredPath` which seems aligned with the new structure, as it's directly using the path property within the directive.

3. **Lines 219-220**: Similar to above, accessing `directiveData.path` directly is consistent with the new structure.

4. **Lines 241-242**: The code accesses `directiveData.content` which is consistent with the new structure where content is directly in the directive object.

5. **Lines 244-246**: The check for `templateContent` and `isInterpolatableValueArray(templateContent)` is appropriate for the new structure where content nodes are directly in the array.

6. **Line 248**: Using `resolveNodes(templateContent, resolutionContext)` is appropriate for the new structure where the content array contains the actual node structures.

7. **Line 267**: Accessing `directiveData.section` directly is correct for the new structure.

8. **Line 276**: The code is using `directiveData.options` which is fine as it's accessing a property of the directive object.

The implementation appears to be already aligned with the new AST structure. It doesn't reference the removed `parameters` or `args` properties. Instead, it correctly uses the `directive` object and its properties (`path`, `content`, `section`, `options`, etc.) directly.

The code also properly handles the `content` array which now contains parsed node structures by using appropriate resolution methods like `resolveNodes()`.

No changes appear to be needed in this implementation to align with the described AST changes.
