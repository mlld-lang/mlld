# Synthesized Requirements for Internal File Path & Import Type Structures

After reviewing feedback from multiple component leads, I've consolidated the key requirements for TypeScript types to represent file paths, file content results, and import definitions.

## 1. Path Type System Requirements

- **Requirement 1.1:** Use branded/nominal types for paths to provide type safety beyond string validation
- **Requirement 1.2:** Distinguish between different path types (absolute vs relative, file vs directory) at the type level
- **Requirement 1.3:** Support path normalization status in the type system (normalized vs raw paths)
- **Requirement 1.4:** Create validation and constructor functions that return the appropriate path types
- **Requirement 1.5:** Support structured path representation with segments, variables, and metadata
- **Requirement 1.6:** Create a discriminated union type to handle both string paths and structured paths
- **Requirement 1.7:** Provide type guards and utility functions for path type checking and conversion

## 2. File Content Representation Requirements

- **Requirement 2.1:** Define a comprehensive interface for file content that includes both content and metadata
- **Requirement 2.2:** Support different content types (text, binary, JSON, Meld) with appropriate type parameters
- **Requirement 2.3:** Include source information (path, encoding, size, last modified) with content
- **Requirement 2.4:** Make content objects immutable (readonly) to prevent accidental modification
- **Requirement 2.5:** Provide factory functions to create properly typed content objects
- **Requirement 2.6:** Support content-type specific operations through specialized interfaces

## 3. Import Definition & Result Requirements

- **Requirement 3.1:** Create a structured representation of import results with clear success/failure status
- **Requirement 3.2:** Track the complete import chain to detect circular dependencies
- **Requirement 3.3:** Support selective imports with name, type, and optional alias information
- **Requirement 3.4:** Include metadata about imported content (timestamps, source location)
- **Requirement 3.5:** Provide a structured way to represent import errors with appropriate context
- **Requirement 3.6:** Support nested imports to represent the complete import hierarchy
- **Requirement 3.7:** Include definition types (text, data, path, command) in the import result

## 4. Source Location Requirements

- **Requirement 4.1:** Define consistent location types that include file path information
- **Requirement 4.2:** Support both basic positions (line/column) and range locations (start/end)
- **Requirement 4.3:** Ensure all errors include properly typed location information
- **Requirement 4.4:** Provide utilities to enhance locations with file paths when needed

## 5. Operation Context Requirements

- **Requirement 5.1:** Define type-safe operation contexts for different file operations
- **Requirement 5.2:** Use discriminated unions to ensure operation-specific properties
- **Requirement 5.3:** Include common metadata (timestamps, paths) in all operation contexts
- **Requirement 5.4:** Provide factory functions to create properly typed context objects

## 6. Validation & Resolution Requirements

- **Requirement 6.1:** Define structured validation rules for paths with clear types
- **Requirement 6.2:** Support resolution contexts with appropriate type information
- **Requirement 6.3:** Define type-safe special path variable handling
- **Requirement 6.4:** Support content type validation as part of path validation

These consolidated requirements provide a comprehensive foundation for designing a type system that will improve safety, maintainability, and developer experience when working with files, paths, and imports in the Meld system.
