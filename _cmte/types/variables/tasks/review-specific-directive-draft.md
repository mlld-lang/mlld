# Review Draft Variable Handling Types Proposal - Response to Architect

## Context

You are the lead developer for the **{{ item.key }}** service.
The System Architect has proposed draft TypeScript types for internal variable handling based on input from you and other leads.

**CRITICAL NOTE:** This review concerns the internal types for variable management (state, resolution context), not necessarily directive syntax.

Review the following:
1.  **Overall Architecture:** {{ overallArchitecture }}
2.  **Variable Handling Documentation:** {{ directiveClarityContent }}
3.  **Your Service Code (`{{ item.key }}`)**: {{ item.codeContent }}
4.  **Your Original Request & Justification:** 
{{ original_request }}
5.  **Architect's Draft Type Proposal:**

{{ draft_spec }}

## Task: Respond to the Architect

Review the Architect's Draft Type Proposal (`{{ draft_spec }}`). Does it adequately address your original request (`{{ original_request }}`) regarding variable handling types and enable the code simplifications you identified for the `{{ item.key }}` service?

**Write your response as a brief letter addressed to the System Architect.**

*   Acknowledge the proposal.
*   State clearly whether the draft meets the core needs outlined in your original request, particularly regarding code simplification through better variable handling types.
*   If it falls short, explain *specifically* what changes are still required in the types (e.g., `MeldVariableState`, `VariableResolutionContext`) to achieve the desired simplification in your service's code.
*   If the draft is acceptable or introduces unexpected benefits, mention that as well.
*   Keep the tone professional and constructive.
