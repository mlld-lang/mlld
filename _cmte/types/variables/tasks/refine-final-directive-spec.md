# Refine Final Specification for Variable Handling Types

## Context

You are the **System Architect**. You have the initial draft spec proposal for internal variable handling types and responses from service leads.

**CRITICAL NOTE:** This final specification concerns the internal types for variable management (state, resolution context).

2.  **Variable Handling Documentation:** {{ directiveClarityContent }}
3.  **Initial Draft Proposal:**

4.  **Collected Service Lead Responses (All):**

## Task: Produce Final TypeScript Specification for Variable Handling

Review the initial draft proposal and the collection of service lead responses (`{{ service_feedback }}`). Synthesize the feedback to identify consensus, conflicts, and necessary adjustments regarding internal variable handling types.

**Produce the final, refined TypeScript type definitions for internal variable handling that best address the collective feedback and enable the code simplifications identified by the service leads.**

*   Incorporate necessary changes based on the feedback.
*   Make final decisions on any outstanding conflicts or requests regarding variable state, resolution context, etc.
*   Ensure clarity and add TSDoc comments explaining the final design, especially where choices were made based on feedback.

**Output Format:** Provide *only* the final TypeScript code block.

```typescript
// Final types for internal variable handling...

/**
 * FINAL: Core structure for variable state storage.
 * @remarks [Justify final decisions based on feedback, e.g., Feedback from Service Z led to strengthening the type property...]
 */
export interface MeldVariableState { // Example
  // ... Final implementation ...
}

/**
 * FINAL: Context passed during variable resolution.
 * @remarks [Explain final structure based on feedback]
 */
export interface VariableResolutionContext { // Example
  // ... Final implementation ...
}

// ... other final types ...
```
