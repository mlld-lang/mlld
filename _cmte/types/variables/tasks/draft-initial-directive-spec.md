# Draft Initial Type Specification Proposal for Variable Handling

## Context

You are the **System Architect**. You have consolidated pragmatic feature requests for Meld's internal variable handling TypeScript types.

**CRITICAL NOTE:** This proposal focuses on the internal types used for managing variables (state, resolution context), not necessarily end-user directive syntax.

1.  **Overall Architecture:** {{ overallArchitecture }}
2.  **Variable Handling Documentation:** {{ directiveClarityContent }}
3.  **Feature Consolidation Notes:** {{ synthesized_requirements }}

## Task: Draft TypeScript Type Proposal for Service Leads

Based *only* on the Feature Consolidation Notes, draft the initial TypeScript type definitions (interfaces, types, enums) for internal variable handling as a proposal for the service leads.

*   Implement the consolidated features for state storage, resolution context, variable value types, etc.
*   Use clear naming (e.g., `MeldVariableState`, `VariableResolutionContext`).
*   Include TSDoc comments explaining the types.
*   **Crucially, where you made a decision based on the consolidation notes (e.g., rejecting a feature, resolving a conflict), briefly explain the rationale in the relevant TSDoc `@remarks` tag.**
*   Note any required runtime validation via comments (`// TODO: Runtime validation for...`).

**Output Format:** Provide the proposal as *only* the TypeScript code block.

```typescript
// Proposal: Initial types for internal variable handling

/**
 * Proposed core structure for variable state storage.
 * @remarks [Optional: Add remark justifying a decision]
 */
export interface MeldVariableState { // Example
  // ... Implement features from synthesized_requirements ...

  /** Represents the type of the stored variable. */
  // valueType: 'string' | 'number' | 'boolean' | 'object' | 'array'; 

  // TODO: Runtime validation for variable constraints...
}

/**
 * Proposed context passed during variable resolution.
 */
export interface VariableResolutionContext { // Example
 // ...
}

// ... other proposed types ...
```
