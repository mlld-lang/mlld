# Synthesized Variable Validation Requirements for Meld

Based on the feedback from component leads, I've consolidated the following validation requirements specifically for variable definitions, references, and state management:

## Static Validation (Compile-Time)

1. **Identifier Validation**
   - Enforce consistent naming conventions for variable identifiers
   - Validate that variable names follow allowed character patterns
   - Check for reserved names that may conflict with system variables

2. **Type System Validation**
   - Ensure variable references specify a valid variable type ('text', 'data', 'path')
   - Validate that variable reference nodes have required properties (identifier, valueType)
   - Verify field access paths have proper syntax in variable references

3. **Structural Validation**
   - Enforce proper structure for variable reference nodes (type, identifier, valueType)
   - Validate that field access expressions follow proper dot notation or index syntax
   - Check that array indices in field paths are numeric when appropriate

4. **Reference Validation**
   - Verify that variable references use the correct syntax based on variable type
   - Ensure consistent structure between variable definition and reference
   - Validate that path variables follow proper path syntax conventions

## Runtime Validation

5. **Existence Checking**
   - Check for variable existence before access, respecting 'strict' mode
   - Provide meaningful error messages when variables don't exist
   - Support default values for non-existent variables based on context

6. **Type Compatibility**
   - Validate that variable values match their declared types at runtime
   - Ensure field access operations are valid for the variable's actual type
   - Verify that array indices are within bounds when accessing array elements

7. **Field Access Validation**
   - Validate that object properties exist when accessing nested fields
   - Check that array indices are valid when accessing array elements
   - Verify method calls are performed on callable properties

8. **Circular Reference Detection**
   - Implement depth tracking to detect potential circular references
   - Set maximum resolution depth to prevent infinite recursion
   - Track variable resolution paths to identify circular dependencies

9. **State Transition Validation**
   - Ensure variables are properly initialized before access
   - Validate state transitions maintain variable integrity
   - Prevent modification of variables in immutable states

10. **Format Validation**
    - Validate that variable formatting requests are compatible with variable types
    - Ensure consistent string conversion based on variable type
    - Verify that transformation operations are valid for the variable type

## Error Handling

11. **Structured Error Reporting**
    - Provide specific error types for different validation failures
    - Include detailed context in error messages (variable name, field path, etc.)
    - Support different error severity levels based on validation context

12. **Validation Context**
    - Pass resolution context through validation chain for consistent handling
    - Support strict/lenient validation modes based on context
    - Allow context-specific validation rules for different execution environments

## Implementation Notes

- Use TypeScript's type system to enforce as many constraints as possible at compile time
- Implement discriminated unions for variable types to ensure exhaustive type checking
- Create specialized validators for each variable type with appropriate validation rules
- Centralize validation logic to ensure consistent behavior across the codebase
- Implement type guards to simplify runtime validation and improve code readability
- Use branded types to enforce semantic constraints on variable identifiers and references

These requirements should guide the implementation of a robust validation system for Meld variables, ensuring consistency, type safety, and proper error handling throughout the language interpreter.
