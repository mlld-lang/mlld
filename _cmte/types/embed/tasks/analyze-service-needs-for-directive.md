# Simplify {{ item.key }} Code with Stronger '@{{ directiveName }}' Types

## Context

You are the lead developer for the **{{ item.key }}** service.
The Meld language is improving its TypeScript type system for the `@{{ directiveName }}` directive.

**CRITICAL NOTE:** The '{{ directiveName }}' directive in Meld **exclusively** embeds *text content* from files or *string values* from variables. It does **not** handle multimedia or web content. Base your analysis ONLY on this Meld-specific definition.

Review the following:
1.  **Overall Architecture:** {{ overallArchitecture }}
2.  **`@{{ directiveName }}` Documentation:** {{ directiveClarityContent }}
3.  **Your Service Code (`{{ item.key }}`)**: {{ item.codeContent }}

## Task: Propose & Justify '@{{ directiveName }}' Type Improvements for Your Code

Examine your service's code (`{{ item.codeContent }}`) where it interacts with the `@{{ directiveName }}` directive.

1.  **Identify areas of complexity, manual validation, or edge-case handling in your code related to this directive.**
2.  **Propose specific TypeScript type features** (e.g., required properties, discriminated unions, literal types) for `@{{ directiveName }}` that would simplify or eliminate these complexities.
3.  **Crucially, make a clear case for *why* each proposed feature is needed.** Explain how it would tangibly benefit the {{ item.key }} service by making the code simpler, safer, or easier to maintain.
