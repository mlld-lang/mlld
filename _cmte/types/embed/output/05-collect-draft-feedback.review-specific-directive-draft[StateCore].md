## Re: Draft TypeScript Types for Embed Directive

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for sharing your draft TypeScript types for the `@embed` directive. I've reviewed the proposal in detail and am pleased to confirm that it addresses most of the core needs outlined in my original request.

### Strengths of the Proposal

The discriminated union pattern with `embedType` as the discriminator is an excellent approach that will significantly improve type safety and code clarity. I particularly appreciate:

1. The clear separation between path, variable, and template embed types
2. The comprehensive documentation that explains each type's specific behavior
3. The inclusion of `VariableReference` with support for field access chains
4. The contextual parameters in `EmbedResolutionContext` that handle path prefixing rules

### Areas for Enhancement

While the proposal is strong, I would suggest a few refinements to better address our implementation needs:

1. **Result Types**: The proposal focuses on parameter types but doesn't include return types for embedded content. Adding an `EmbeddedContent` result type (as in my original request) would complete the type system and simplify our service code.

2. **Metadata Support**: Consider adding metadata fields to the result types to support debugging and tracing. This would eliminate many manual property assignments in our implementation.

3. **Method Signatures**: The proposal doesn't include the method signatures I suggested (`readFileAsEmbedContent`, `embedFromVariable`, etc.). These would provide a clearer API for consumers and enforce proper parameter usage.

### Unexpected Benefits

Your proposal introduces several benefits I hadn't initially considered:

1. The `SourceLocation` interface will be invaluable for error reporting
2. The section targeting parameters (`section`, `headingLevel`, etc.) add functionality we hadn't planned for but will certainly use
3. The TODO comments provide clear guidance for runtime validation requirements

### Conclusion

Overall, your draft provides an excellent foundation that meets most of our needs. With the addition of result types and method signatures, it will fully address the code simplification goals in the StateCore service. I look forward to implementing these types and seeing the improvements in code clarity and maintainability.

Please let me know if you'd like to discuss any of these suggestions in more detail.
