# Response to System Architect

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for the draft TypeScript types for the `@embed` directive. I've reviewed your proposal in detail and am pleased to confirm it addresses the core needs outlined in my original request while providing several additional benefits.

## Strengths of the Proposal

The discriminated union pattern with `EmbedType` as the discriminator is particularly valuable for our `VariableResolution` service, as it will allow us to:

1. **Correctly identify embed types at compile time**, eliminating many runtime checks we currently perform
2. **Simplify our variable resolution logic** by having clear type boundaries between path, variable, and template embeds
3. **Enforce proper resolution context settings** through the `EmbedResolutionContext` interface

I'm especially impressed with the `VariableReference` interface and `FieldAccess` type, which align perfectly with our field access implementation in the `VariableReferenceResolver`. This will significantly simplify our code for handling property access chains.

## Suggested Refinements

While the proposal is strong, I would suggest two minor refinements:

1. Consider adding a `rawContent` field to `TemplateEmbedParams` to store the original template string before any processing (including first newline removal)

2. In `EmbedResolutionContext`, I recommend making `allowedVariableTypes` default to allowing all types, with explicit opt-out rather than opt-in, to match our current implementation

## Implementation Impact

This type system will allow us to refactor several complex areas in our `VariableReferenceResolver` class:

- Replace our current `determineSubtype()` method with straightforward type discrimination
- Eliminate conditional logic that attempts to detect variable references
- Simplify our field access implementation by leveraging the `FieldAccess` type

## Conclusion

Overall, your proposal exceeds my expectations and will significantly improve code maintainability and type safety in our service. The types are well-aligned with Meld's architecture and the actual behavior of the `@embed` directive, making the code more self-documenting.

I'm ready to implement these changes as soon as the types are finalized.

Sincerely,

Lead Developer, VariableResolution Service
