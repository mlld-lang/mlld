# Response to System Architect's Draft Embed Types Proposal

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for your thorough draft TypeScript types for the `@embed` directive. As the lead developer for the ResolutionCore service, I've reviewed your proposal in detail against our implementation needs.

## Overall Assessment

Your proposed type structure effectively addresses the core challenges I identified with embedding content in Meld. The discriminated union pattern with `embedType` as the discriminator provides the clear type boundaries we need, while maintaining flexibility for all three embed scenarios.

## Strengths of the Proposal

1. **Strong Type Discrimination**: The `EmbedType` enum and discriminated union pattern will eliminate many of our current runtime checks, allowing for more predictable code paths.

2. **Context Controls for Path Resolution**: The `EmbedResolutionContext` interface with flags like `isVariableEmbed` and `disablePathPrefixing` directly addresses our path resolution ambiguity issues, which have been a source of subtle bugs.

3. **Comprehensive Field Access Support**: The `VariableReference` and `FieldAccess` interfaces provide the structured approach to field access we need for consistent behavior across the codebase.

4. **Future-Proof Design**: The base/extended interface approach allows for adding new embed types or parameters in the future without breaking existing code.

## Implementation Considerations

The `VariableReference` interface with its `isVariableReference: true` flag is particularly valuable for our service. This explicit marker will help us maintain the critical distinction between paths and variables during resolution, which is essential to prevent directory prefixing on variable content.

The `EmbedResolutionContext` interface aligns perfectly with our current `ResolutionContext` type, making integration straightforward.

## Suggested Refinements

While the proposal is strong, I suggest a few minor refinements:

1. Consider adding a `resolvedContent` field to the `TemplateEmbedParams` interface to store the post-variable-resolution content.

2. For the `VariableReference` interface, it might be helpful to add a `originalText` field to preserve the exact syntax used in the source for debugging.

3. The `FieldAccess` interface could benefit from a `rawSyntax` field to preserve the original syntax (e.g., `.field` or `[0]`) for error reporting.

## Conclusion

Overall, your draft proposal meets our needs excellently and will significantly improve type safety and code maintainability in the ResolutionCore service. The proposed types will allow us to eliminate numerous manual checks and special cases in our code, particularly around the critical path prefixing behavior that has been a source of bugs.

We're ready to begin implementation based on these types, with the minor refinements suggested above.

Thank you for your thoughtful work on this proposal.

Sincerely,
Lead Developer, ResolutionCore Service
