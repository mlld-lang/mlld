# Response to System Architect

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for providing the draft TypeScript types for the `@embed` directive. I've carefully reviewed the proposal against the requirements for the ContentResolution service.

## Overall Assessment

The proposed type system is well-structured and addresses most of the core needs outlined in my original request. The discriminated union pattern with `embedType` as the discriminator provides the type safety and clarity we need.

## Strengths of the Proposal

1. The clean separation between path, variable, and template embeds through distinct interfaces perfectly captures the three embed scenarios we handle.

2. The `VariableReference` interface with support for field access chains will significantly simplify our variable resolution code.

3. The `EmbedResolutionContext` interface provides the necessary configuration options to handle the critical path prefixing behavior differences between embed types.

4. The inclusion of source location information will improve our error reporting capabilities.

## Suggested Refinements

While the proposal is strong, I would suggest a few refinements to better align with our implementation needs:

1. **Content Handling**: Consider adding a `content` field to all embed types, not just TemplateEmbedParams, to store the resolved content consistently across all embed types.

2. **Result Type**: It would be helpful to define a standardized `EmbedResult` interface that includes both the resolved content and metadata about the embed operation.

3. **Resolution Status**: Adding a status field to track whether an embed has been successfully resolved would help with error handling and debugging.

## Implementation Impact

These types will enable us to refactor the ContentResolver to use type guards for cleaner code:

```typescript
if (params.embedType === EmbedType.VARIABLE) {
  // TypeScript knows this is VariableEmbedParams
  return this.resolveVariableEmbed(params.variable);
}
```

This will eliminate our current manual type checking and string parsing logic, reducing potential bugs and improving maintainability.

## Conclusion

The proposed type system is a significant improvement over our current approach and will enable more robust implementation of the `@embed` directive in the ContentResolution service. With the minor refinements suggested above, it will fully meet our needs.

I look forward to implementing these types in our service and appreciate the thoughtful design work that went into this proposal.

Sincerely,

Lead Developer, ContentResolution Service
