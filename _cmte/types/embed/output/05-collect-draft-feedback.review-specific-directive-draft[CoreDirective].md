# Response to System Architect

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for sharing your draft TypeScript type proposal for the `@embed` directive. I've reviewed it carefully against our current implementation in the CoreDirective service.

## Evaluation of the Proposal

Your proposed type system effectively addresses the core challenges I identified in my original request:

1. **Strong Type Discrimination**: The discriminated union pattern with `embedType` as the discriminator provides excellent type safety and clarity.

2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All three embed types (path, variable, template) are properly represented with their specific behaviors and constraints.

3. **Context-Aware Resolution**: The `EmbedResolutionContext` interface explicitly handles the critical path prefixing behavior differences between embed types.

4. **Metadata Support**: The `SourceLocation` interface provides helpful context for error reporting.

## Specific Strengths

I particularly appreciate:

- The explicit handling of variable references with proper field access support
- The clear separation between template content and variable resolution
- The inclusion of formatting options like `ignoreFirstNewline` that align with our actual implementation needs
- The well-documented interfaces that serve as self-documentation

## Implementation Impact

This type system will significantly simplify our implementation in the EmbedDirectiveHandler by:

1. Replacing our current `determineSubtype` method with straightforward type discrimination
2. Eliminating manual validation of parameter combinations
3. Providing compile-time checks for our resolution context configuration
4. Making our handler methods more focused and maintainable

## Suggestions for Enhancement

While the proposal is strong, I would suggest two minor additions:

1. Consider adding a `result` field to the `EmbedParams` interfaces to capture the resolved content after processing
2. It might be helpful to include a `transformOptions` field for future extensibility with transformation-specific settings

## Conclusion

Overall, your type proposal exceeds my expectations and will significantly improve code maintainability and type safety in our `@embed` directive handling. I'm confident these types will help prevent bugs related to path resolution and variable embedding that have been challenging in the past.

I look forward to implementing these types in the CoreDirective service.

Lead Developer, CoreDirective Service
