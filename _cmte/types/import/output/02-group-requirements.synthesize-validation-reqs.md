# Synthesized File Import Validation Requirements

Based on the comprehensive feedback from multiple component leads, I've consolidated the key validation requirements for file paths, file access, and `@import` directives.

## Static Validation Requirements (Compile-Time)

1. **Path Type Safety**
   - Validate path format (absolute vs. relative)
   - Ensure paths are properly typed (using branded types)
   - Distinguish between validated and unvalidated paths
   - Prevent mixing of incompatible path types

2. **Import Directive Syntax**
   - Validate `@import` directive structure
   - Verify path parameter is present and properly formatted
   - Validate optional parameters (section, fuzzy match threshold)
   - Check selective import syntax (names, aliases, types)

3. **Path Structure**
   - Reject paths with null bytes or other invalid characters
   - Validate path normalization (handling of `.`, `..`, etc.)
   - Check for proper path separators (forward/backward slashes)
   - Verify path length doesn't exceed system limits

4. **File Content Type Validation**
   - Validate expected content type based on file extension
   - Ensure content type is compatible with import purpose
   - Check encoding compatibility for text files

## Runtime Validation Requirements

5. **File Existence and Access**
   - Verify target file exists
   - Check read permissions for the file
   - Validate file type (regular file vs. directory)
   - Handle file system errors gracefully

6. **Path Resolution**
   - Resolve relative paths to absolute paths
   - Handle special path variables (`$PROJECTPATH`, `$HOMEPATH`, etc.)
   - Validate paths don't escape base directory (path traversal protection)
   - Normalize paths for consistent comparison

7. **Circular Dependency Detection**
   - Track import chains to detect circular dependencies
   - Maintain import hierarchy for nested imports
   - Provide clear error messages for circular references
   - Set maximum import depth to prevent stack overflow

8. **Content Validation**
   - Validate that imported content is properly formatted
   - Check for required sections when section imports are used
   - Verify content can be parsed according to expected format
   - Handle malformed content with appropriate error messages

9. **Selective Import Validation**
   - Verify that selectively imported items exist in source file
   - Validate alias names follow naming conventions
   - Check for duplicate aliases or name conflicts
   - Ensure proper typing of imported items (text, data, path, command)

## Error Handling Requirements

10. **Structured Error Reporting**
    - Provide detailed error location information (file, line, column)
    - Include context about the import chain in error messages
    - Categorize errors by type (file not found, permission denied, etc.)
    - Return structured error objects with consistent format

11. **Graceful Fallbacks**
    - Define fallback behavior for non-critical validation failures
    - Support partial imports when some items can't be resolved
    - Provide warnings for potential issues without failing completely

## Implementation Considerations

12. **Performance Optimization**
    - Cache validated paths to avoid redundant validation
    - Optimize file existence checks for frequently accessed files
    - Implement lazy validation for non-critical checks

13. **Security Considerations**
    - Prevent path traversal attacks
    - Validate file content to prevent injection attacks
    - Implement proper permission checks
    - Sanitize file paths before use in sensitive operations

This consolidated set of requirements provides a comprehensive framework for implementing robust file import validation in the system, covering both static and runtime checks while maintaining good performance and security practices.
