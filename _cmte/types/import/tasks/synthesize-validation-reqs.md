# Synthesize File/Import Validation Requirements

## Context

You are the **System Architect**. You have received feedback from component leads regarding the validation rules needed for file paths, file access, and the `@import` directive.

**CRITICAL NOTE:** Focus *only* on validation requirements (static and runtime) for paths, file I/O, and `@import` syntax/semantics.

**PathService Feedback (Path Syntax/Validity):**

## Task: Synthesize File/Import Validation Requirements

Review the provided feedback. Consolidate the requirements related *specifically* to the validation of file paths, file access, and `@import` directives.

*   Identify necessary static checks (e.g., `@import` syntax, path format).
*   Note required runtime checks (e.g., file existence, read permissions, circular imports).
*   Consolidate rules for validating selective import lists and aliases.

**Output Format:** Produce concise notes outlining the synthesized validation requirements for file/import operations.

### Synthesized Requirements: File/Import Validation

*   Requirement 1: (e.g., Validate `@import` syntax variations.)
*   Requirement 2: (e.g., Runtime check for target file existence.)
*   Requirement 3: (e.g., Runtime check for read permissions.)
*   Requirement 4: (e.g., Runtime check for circular imports.)
*   Requirement 5: (e.g., Validate syntax of selective import lists/aliases.)
*   (List other key validation requirements)
