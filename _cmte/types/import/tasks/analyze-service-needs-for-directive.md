# Simplify {{ item.key }} Code with Stronger File/Import Handling Types

## Context

You are the lead developer for the **{{ item.key }}** service.
The Meld language is improving its TypeScript type system related to file handling, path resolution, and the import mechanism (including related directives like `@text`, `@path`).

**CRITICAL NOTE:** This task focuses on internal types used for file system interactions, path validation/resolution, and the data structures related to importing content, potentially involving directives like `@text` and `@path`. Base your analysis on how file/import operations are handled *internally* by your service.

Review the following:
1.  **Overall Architecture:** {{ overallArchitecture }}
2.  **Import/File Handling Documentation:** {{ directiveClarityContent }}
3.  **Your Service Code (`{{ item.key }}`)**: {{ item.codeContent }}

## Task: Propose & Justify Import/File Handling Type Improvements for Your Code

Examine your service's code (`{{ item.codeContent }}`) where it interacts with file reading/writing, path resolution/validation, or the processing of imported content (potentially via directives like `@text`, `@path`).

1.  **Identify areas of complexity, manual validation, type casting, or edge-case handling in your code related to file paths, content types, or import data structures.**
2.  **Propose specific TypeScript type features** (e.g., stricter path types, clearer file content representations, improved import result interfaces) that would simplify or eliminate these complexities.
3.  **Crucially, make a clear case for *why* each proposed feature is needed.** Explain how it would tangibly benefit the {{ item.key }} service by making the code simpler, safer, or easier to maintain when dealing with files and imports.
