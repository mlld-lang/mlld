# Consolidate Synthesized Requirements for File/Import Handling

## Context

You are the **System Architect**. Requirements for Meld's internal file/import handling related to type structure, runtime execution, and validation have been synthesized separately.

**CRITICAL NOTE:** Your goal now is to combine these synthesized notes into a final, pragmatic feature list for the draft specification for internal file/import types.

1.  **Overall Architecture:** {{ overallArchitecture }}
2.  **Import/File Handling Documentation:** {{ directiveClarityContent }}
3.  **Synthesized File/Path Structure Requirements:**

{{ subtype_reqs }}

4.  **Synthesized File/Import Execution Requirements:**

{{ execution_reqs }}

5.  **Synthesized File/Import Validation Requirements:**

{{ validation_reqs }}

## Task: Consolidate Final Features Pragmatically

Review the three sets of synthesized requirements provided above.

**Your goal is to combine these into a final, pragmatic list of desired features for the initial type spec draft for internal file/import handling.**

*   **Integrate & Prioritize:** Combine the features from the three inputs, prioritizing those with the highest impact and alignment with architectural goals for file and import management.
*   **Ensure Cohesion:** Make sure the combined features for structure, execution, and validation work together logically.
*   **Resolve Final Conflicts:** Address any remaining minor conflicts between the synthesized notes.
*   **Explain Key Decisions:** Briefly document your reasoning for the final selection and prioritization.

**Output Format:** Produce concise notes outlining the *final consolidated* features and key decisions, ready to inform the drafting process for file/import handling types. Use a simple bulleted list format.

### FINAL Feature Consolidation Notes for File/Import Handling Draft

*   **Feature 1:** (e.g., Final decision on `MeldFilePath` type based on subtype_reqs)
*   **Feature 2:** (e.g., Key validation rules for `@import` from validation_reqs)
*   **Feature 3:** (e.g., Requirements for state merging during import from execution_reqs)
*   **Rejected/Deferred Feature:** (Explain final decision)
*   (Continue listing key features for the draft)
