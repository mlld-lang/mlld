# Synthesize File/Import Execution Requirements

## Context

You are the **System Architect**. You have received feedback from component leads regarding the runtime execution of file I/O, path resolution, and the `@import` mechanism.

**CRITICAL NOTE:** Focus *only* on the requirements for the *runtime execution* of reading files, resolving paths, interpreting imported files, and merging state.

### Feedback on Execution/Runtime:

**FileSystemCore Feedback (File IO):**

**PathService Feedback (Runtime Resolution):**

**PathResolution Feedback (Runtime Resolution):**

**InterpreterCore Feedback (Interpreting Imports):**

## Task: Synthesize File/Import Execution Requirements

Review the provided feedback. Consolidate the requirements related *specifically* to the runtime execution of file/import operations.

*   Identify needs for path resolution context and error handling.
*   Note requirements for file reading (encoding, error handling).
*   Consolidate needs for the `@import` execution flow (interpretation of target, state merging, circularity detection).
*   List requirements for error handling during imports.

**Output Format:** Produce concise notes outlining the synthesized requirements for the file/import execution process.

### Synthesized Requirements: File/Import Execution

*   Requirement 1: (e.g., Path resolution must handle `$PROJECTPATH` correctly...)
*   Requirement 2: (e.g., File reading should support specific encodings...)
*   Requirement 3: (e.g., `@import` needs robust circularity detection via CircularityService...)
*   Requirement 4: (e.g., State merging must handle aliases and selective imports correctly...)
*   (List other key execution requirements)
