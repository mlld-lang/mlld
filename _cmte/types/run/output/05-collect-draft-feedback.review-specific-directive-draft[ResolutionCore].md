# Response to the System Architect

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for sharing the draft TypeScript types for the `@run` directive. I've reviewed the proposal in detail, and I'm pleased to say it effectively addresses the core needs we identified for the ResolutionCore service.

The discriminated union pattern for the `RunDirective` type with its three subtypes (`BasicCommandRun`, `LanguageCommandRun`, and `DefinedCommandRun`) will significantly simplify our code by enabling proper type narrowing during execution flow. This will eliminate many of our current conditional checks and allow us to create specialized handlers for each run type.

I particularly appreciate:

1. The clear separation of parameter handling between the different command types, which will help us standardize variable resolution
2. The comprehensive `ExecutionContext` interface that centralizes security controls
3. The unified `CommandReference` type that handles both string-based and AST-based references, which will help us consolidate our currently fragmented approach

The proposed types will enable us to refactor our command execution logic into a more maintainable pattern. Instead of our current approach with complex nested conditionals, we'll be able to implement a cleaner strategy pattern with specialized handlers for each run directive subtype.

One minor enhancement I'd suggest is adding a `formattingOptions` field to the `ExecutionResult` interface to control how command output is rendered in the final document, but this can be addressed in a future iteration.

The proposal exceeds my expectations by providing a complete type system that covers not just the core directive types but also the execution context and result interfaces we'll need for implementation.

Looking forward to implementing these types in the ResolutionCore service.

Regards,
Lead Developer, ResolutionCore Service
