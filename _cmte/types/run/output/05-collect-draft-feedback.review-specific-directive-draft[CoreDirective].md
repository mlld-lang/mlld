# Response to the System Architect

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for sharing the draft TypeScript types for the `@run` directive. I've thoroughly reviewed the proposal and am pleased to provide feedback as the lead developer for the CoreDirective service.

## Overall Assessment

The proposed type specification is excellent and addresses the key challenges we've been facing with the `@run` directive. The discriminated union pattern for the different subtypes (BasicCommandRun, LanguageCommandRun, and DefinedCommandRun) will significantly simplify our code by enabling proper type narrowing and validation.

## Specific Strengths

1. **Clear Subtype Classification**: The discriminated union with the `type` field will allow us to properly classify run directives early in the pipeline, solving one of our major pain points.

2. **Unified Command Reference Handling**: The `CommandReference` type elegantly unifies the previously disparate AST-based and string-based reference implementations.

3. **Standardized Parameter Resolution**: The `Parameter` and `CommandArg` types provide a consistent approach to parameter extraction and substitution across all run types.

4. **Execution Context Abstraction**: The `ExecutionContext` interface provides a clean way to handle different execution environments with appropriate security controls.

## Implementation Benefits

This type structure will enable us to refactor the RunDirectiveHandler to:

1. Clearly distinguish between run directive subtypes during parsing
2. Implement specialized handlers for each subtype with proper type safety
3. Standardize parameter resolution across command types
4. Provide consistent output transformation for all command types

## Suggested Enhancements

While the proposal is strong, I'd like to suggest a few minor enhancements:

1. Consider adding an optional `captureOutput: boolean` flag to the `RunDirectiveBase` interface to explicitly indicate whether command output should be captured and returned.

2. It might be helpful to include an optional `shellOptions` field in the `BasicCommandRun` interface for shell-specific execution settings (like shell type).

3. For the `LanguageCommandRun`, perhaps add support for script timeout separate from the general execution timeout.

## Conclusion

The proposed type specification meets our core needs and will enable the code simplifications we've been hoping for. The discriminated union pattern in particular will make our directive classification and handling much more robust. I'm confident that implementing these types will significantly improve the maintainability and reliability of our `@run` directive handling.

I look forward to implementing these types in the CoreDirective service and collaborating on any further refinements.

Sincerely,

Lead Developer, CoreDirective Service
