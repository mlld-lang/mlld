# Response to System Architect

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for sharing the draft TypeScript types for the `@run` directive. I've thoroughly reviewed the proposal against our requirements for the RunValidation service.

I'm pleased to confirm that the proposed type structure excellently addresses our needs. The discriminated union pattern with clear subtypes (`BasicCommandRun`, `LanguageCommandRun`, and `DefinedCommandRun`) will significantly simplify our validation logic by enabling type-specific checks through pattern matching.

The proposal offers several key benefits that will improve our codebase:

1. **Clear Subtype Classification**: The discriminated union with the `type` property will eliminate our current complex classification logic, allowing us to handle each run directive variant with dedicated validation rules.

2. **Standardized Parameter Handling**: The unified approach to parameters and arguments with consistent types will streamline our parameter validation and resolution process.

3. **Comprehensive Security Controls**: The `ExecutionContext` interface with detailed security settings provides the foundation we need to implement proper command execution safeguards.

4. **Command Definition Structure**: The `CommandDefinition` interface will enable us to properly validate defined commands against their templates and parameter constraints.

One particularly valuable addition is the `IRunDirectiveExecutor` interface, which provides a clean API boundary for our service. This will help us separate validation from execution concerns, making the code more testable and maintainable.

The only minor suggestion I have is to consider adding a validation-specific type that could capture more complex validation rules for the security context, such as path traversal checks or command injection prevention patterns. However, this is something we can extend in the future as needed.

I look forward to implementing these types in our service. They will enable the code simplifications we've been hoping for and provide a solid foundation for future enhancements to the `@run` directive functionality.

Sincerely,
Lead Developer, RunValidation Service
