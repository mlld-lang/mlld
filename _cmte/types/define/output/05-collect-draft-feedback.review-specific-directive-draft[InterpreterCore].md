# Re: Draft TypeScript Types for @define Directive

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for your comprehensive type definition proposal for the `@define` directive. After reviewing it in detail, I'm pleased to confirm that your proposal not only meets the core needs outlined in my original request but exceeds them in several important ways.

## Strengths of the Proposal

Your discriminated union approach with `IBasicCommandDefinition` and `ILanguageCommandDefinition` extending from a common `ICommandDefinitionBase` provides exactly the type safety we need. The inclusion of type guards (`isBasicCommand` and `isLanguageCommand`) will significantly simplify our runtime type checking.

I particularly appreciate:

1. The detailed parameter metadata structure that includes position information, which is critical for our positional parameter substitution
2. The clear distinction between basic shell commands and language-specific commands
3. The comprehensive `ICommandRegistry` interface that will integrate well with our StateService
4. The thorough `ICommandExecutionContext` that includes all the services needed for command execution

## Additional Benefits

Your proposal introduces several benefits I hadn't explicitly requested but will greatly improve our implementation:

1. The source location tracking for error reporting will help us provide better diagnostics
2. The visibility and description metadata fields support future documentation features
3. The command definition options interface provides flexibility for future extensions

## Implementation Impact

With these types, we can eliminate numerous runtime checks and error cases in the InterpreterCore service. The discriminated union pattern will allow us to handle different command types with compile-time safety, and the parameter metadata will make parameter validation much more straightforward.

## Conclusion

I approve this type proposal without reservations and look forward to implementing it in the InterpreterCore service. The proposed structure aligns perfectly with our dependency injection architecture and will make our code more maintainable and robust.

Thank you for your excellent work on this. Please proceed with finalizing these types so we can begin implementation.
