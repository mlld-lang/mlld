Dear System Architect,

Thank you for the draft TypeScript type definitions for the `@define` directive. I've carefully reviewed the proposal against our requirements for the CoreDirective service.

The proposed type system effectively addresses the key needs I outlined in my original request. In particular:

1. The discriminated union pattern with `IBasicCommandDefinition` and `ILanguageCommandDefinition` provides the type safety we need to distinguish between shell commands and language-specific commands.

2. The `ICommandParameterMetadata` interface offers strong typing for parameters, including position information which is critical for our positional parameter substitution.

3. The type guards (`isBasicCommand` and `isLanguageCommand`) will significantly simplify our conditional logic when processing different command types.

4. The `ICommandRegistry` interface aligns well with our StateService integration needs and provides a clear API for command storage and retrieval.

One enhancement I would suggest is adding an explicit `commandType` field to the `ICommandExecutionContext` interface to help with logging and error reporting. This would make it clearer whether we're executing a basic shell command or a language-specific command.

The proposal actually introduces several benefits I hadn't anticipated:

1. The source location tracking will be invaluable for error reporting, particularly in complex templates.
2. The visibility metadata provides a foundation for future access control features.
3. The command validation infrastructure is more comprehensive than what I initially proposed.

I believe implementing these types will significantly improve our service's reliability and maintainability. The structure aligns well with Meld's architecture and dependency injection patterns, and should integrate smoothly with our existing codebase.

Thank you for your thorough work on this proposal.

Regards,
Lead Developer, CoreDirective Service
