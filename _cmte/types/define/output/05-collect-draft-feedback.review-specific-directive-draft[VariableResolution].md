# Response to System Architect Regarding @define Types Proposal

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for sharing your draft TypeScript type definitions for the `@define` directive. I've carefully reviewed your proposal against our requirements for the VariableResolution service.

## Overall Assessment

Your proposed type system is comprehensive and well-structured, with clear separation between basic shell commands and language-specific commands. The discriminated union pattern aligns well with Meld's existing architecture and will provide excellent type safety.

## Strengths of the Proposal

1. The `ICommandParameterMetadata` interface with positional information will significantly help our parameter substitution logic
2. The distinction between `IBasicCommandDefinition` and `ILanguageCommandDefinition` matches the actual behavior differences we need to support
3. The type guards (`isBasicCommand`/`isLanguageCommand`) will simplify our conditional logic when processing different command types
4. The `ICommandExecutionContext` provides all the necessary dependencies our service needs for resolution

## Suggested Refinements

While the proposal is strong, I'd like to suggest a few refinements specifically for variable resolution needs:

1. **Variable Resolution Context**: Since our service focuses on resolving `{{varName}}` references, it would be helpful to add a `variableResolutionMode` field to `ICommandExecutionContext` that specifies when variables should be resolved (e.g., 'immediate', 'deferred', or 'none' for language commands)

2. **Parameter Validation**: For our validation needs, consider adding a `validateParameterNames(definition: ICommandDefinition): string[]` utility function that returns any parameter names that don't follow identifier rules

3. **Resolution Tracking**: Add an optional `resolutionMetadata?: Record<string, unknown>` field to the base definition to help with debugging variable resolution issues

## Implementation Impact

These types will significantly simplify our code by:
- Eliminating manual type checking and casting
- Providing clear interfaces for interacting with the state service
- Enabling better error handling with specific error types
- Supporting both immediate and deferred variable resolution patterns

## Conclusion

The proposed type system meets our core needs and will help improve the reliability of the VariableResolution service. With the minor refinements suggested above, it will provide an excellent foundation for implementing robust variable resolution within command templates.

Thank you for your thoughtful work on this proposal. I look forward to implementing these types in our service.

Regards,

Lead Developer, VariableResolution Service
