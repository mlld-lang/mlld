# Meld Architecture

## INTRODUCTION

Meld is a specialized, directive-based scripting language designed for embedding small "@directives" inside an otherwise plain text (e.g., Markdown-like) document. The code in this repository implements:

• Meld grammar rules and token types (e.g., text directives, path directives, data directives).  
• The parsing layer that converts Meld content into an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).  
• A directive interpretation layer that processes these AST nodes and manipulates internal "states" to store variables and more.  
• A resolution layer to handle variable references, path expansions, data manipulations, etc.  
• Testing utilities and an in-memory FS (memfs) to simulate filesystems for thorough testing.  

The main idea:  
1. Meld code is parsed to an AST.  
2. Each directive node is validated and interpreted, updating a shared "state" (variables, data structures, commands, etc.).  
3. Optional transformations (e.g., output formatting) generate final representations (Markdown, LLM-friendly XML, etc.).  

Below is an overview of the directory and service-level architecture, referencing code from this codebase.

## DEPENDENCY INJECTION ARCHITECTURE

Meld uses TSyringe for dependency injection, which brings the following benefits:

• Decoupled service creation from service usage
• Simplified testing with mock injections
• Clear dependencies between services
• Centralized service configuration

### DI Core Concepts

1. **Service Registration**: Services are registered with the DI container via the `@Service()` decorator, which handles automatic registration with the container.

2. **Dependency Injection**: Services declare their dependencies using constructor parameters with the `@inject()` decorator, allowing the container to provide the correct dependencies.

3. **Container Resolution**: The container automatically resolves dependencies when creating instances, managing the entire dependency tree.

4. **Interface-based Design**: Services follow an interface-first design pattern, where each service implements an interface (e.g., `IFileSystemService`) and dependencies are declared using interface tokens.

5. **Circular Dependency Handling**: Circular dependencies are managed through the Client Factory pattern, which creates focused client interfaces for specific service interactions.

### DI Configuration

The core DI configuration is managed in `core/di-config.ts`, which:

1. Configures the global container
2. Registers core services and client factories
3. Connects services via their respective client interfaces
4. Registers remaining services using class registrations

## CORE LIBRARIES & THEIR ROLE

### meld-ast 
   • parse(content: string): MeldNode[]  
   • Basic parsing that identifies directives vs. text nodes.  
   • Produces an AST which other services manipulate.  

### llmxml 
   • Converts content to an LLM-friendly XML format or can parse partially.  
   • OutputService may call it if user requests "llm" format.  

### meld-spec
   • Contains interface definitions for MeldNode, DirectiveNode, TextNode, etc.  
   • Contains directive kind enumerations.  

### tsyringe
   • Provides the dependency injection container
   • Manages service creation and resolution
   • Handles dependencies between services

## HIGH-LEVEL FLOW

Below is a simplified flow of how Meld content is processed:

   ┌─────────────────────────────┐
   │   Meld Source Document      │
   └─────────────────────────────┘
                │
                ▼
   ┌─────────────────────────────┐
   │ ParserService.parse(...)    │
   │   → uses meld-ast to parse  │
   └─────────────────────────────┘
                │ AST (MeldNode[])
                ▼
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ InterpreterService.interpret(nodes, options)    │
   │   → For each node, pass to DirectiveService     │
   │   → Handles node transformations                │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                │
                ▼
   ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ DirectiveService                         │
   │   → Routes to correct directive handler  │
   │   → Handlers can provide replacements    │
   └──────────────────────────────────────────┘
                │
                ▼
   ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ StateService + ResolutionService + Others     │
   │   → Stores variables and transformed nodes    │
   │   → Path expansions, data lookups, etc.       │
   └───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                │
                ▼
   ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ OutputService                            │
   │   → Uses transformed nodes for output    │
   │   → Generates clean, directive-free      │
   │     markdown, LLM XML, or other formats  │
   └──────────────────────────────────────────┘

This flow is orchestrated through DI, where the container resolves all required services and their dependencies automatically. The DI container handles service creation, ensuring each service gets the dependencies it needs to function properly.

## MAJOR SERVICES (OVERVIEW)

   - Provides clean output without directive definitions
   - Dependencies: StateService, ResolutionService, VariableReferenceResolverClient

## TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE

All tests are heavily reliant on a memory-based filesystem (memfs) for isolation and speed. The major testing utilities include:

### TestContainerHelper
   - Manages DI containers for tests
   - Provides isolated container creation
   - Supports mock registration and service resolution
   - Handles container cleanup between tests
   - Detects container state leaks

### TestContextDI
   - Central test harness that extends TestContext with DI support
   - Creates a DI container for each test
   - Provides mock service registration
   - Supports child context creation
   - Ensures proper cleanup after tests
   - Resolves services from the container for testing

### MemfsTestFileSystem  
   - Thin wrapper around memfs  
   - Offers readFile, writeFile, mkdir, etc. with in-memory data  
   - Provides an ephemeral environment for all test IO  

### TestContext  
   - Base class for testing environment
   - Provides references to all major services
   - Allows writing files, snapshotting the FS, and comparing  

### TestSnapshot  
   - Takes "snapshots" of the current Memfs FS, storing a Map<filePath, content>  
   - Compares snapshots to detect added/removed/modified files  

### ProjectBuilder  
   - Creates mock "projects" in the in-memory FS from JSON structure  
   - Useful for complex, multi-file tests or large fixture-based testing  

### Node Factories  
   - Provides helper functions for creating AST nodes in tests  
   - Supports creating directive, text, and code fence nodes  
   - Includes location utilities for source mapping  

Testing Organization:
• tests/utils/: Core test infrastructure (MemFS, snapshots, contexts)  
• tests/utils/di/: DI-specific test utilities
• tests/mocks/: Minimal mocks and test doubles  
• tests/fixtures/: JSON-based test data  
• tests/services/: Service-specific integration tests  

Testing Approach:
• Each test uses TestContextDI to create a fresh container
• Direct service resolution from the container
• Mock registration for dependencies
• Isolated container state between tests
• Factory functions for creating test nodes and data
• Snapshots for tracking filesystem changes  

## DEBUGGING INFRASTRUCTURE

The codebase includes specialized debugging services located in `tests/utils/debug/` that help diagnose and troubleshoot state-related issues:

### StateDebuggerService
   - Provides debug session management and diagnostics
   - Tracks state operations and transformations
   - Offers operation tracing and analysis
   - Helps identify state manipulation issues

### StateVisualizationService
   - Generates visual representations of state
   - Creates Mermaid/DOT graphs of state relationships
   - Visualizes state metrics and transformations
   - Aids in understanding complex state changes

### StateHistoryService
   - Records chronological state changes
   - Maintains operation history
   - Tracks transformation chains
   - Enables state change replay and analysis

### StateTrackingService
   - Monitors state relationships and dependencies
   - Tracks state lineage and inheritance
   - Records metadata about state changes
   - Helps debug scope and inheritance issues

Debugging Approach:
• Services can be enabled selectively in tests
• Debug output includes detailed state snapshots
• Visual representations help understand complex states
• History tracking enables step-by-step analysis

These debugging services are particularly useful for:
• Troubleshooting complex state transformations
• Understanding directive processing chains
• Analyzing variable resolution paths
• Debugging scope inheritance issues
• Visualizing state relationships

## SERVICE RELATIONSHIPS AND DEPENDENCY INJECTION

Services in Meld follow a dependency graph managed through the DI container:

1. Base Services:
   - FileSystemService (depends on PathOperationsService, PathServiceClient)
   - PathService (depends on FileSystemServiceClient)

2. State Management:
   - StateEventService (no dependencies)
   - StateService (depends on StateFactory, StateEventService, StateTrackingService)

3. Core Pipeline:
   - ParserService (depends on ResolutionServiceClient)
   - ResolutionService (depends on StateService, FileSystemService, PathService, ParserServiceClient)
   - ValidationService (depends on ResolutionService)
   - CircularityService (depends on ResolutionService)

4. Pipeline Orchestration:
   - DirectiveService (depends on multiple services)
   - InterpreterService (orchestrates others)

5. Output Generation:
   - OutputService (depends on StateService, ResolutionService, VariableReferenceResolverClient)

6. Debug Support:
   - DebuggerService (optional, depends on all)

## Dependency Resolution Patterns

### Circular Dependency Challenges

Circular dependencies occur when two or more services depend on each other, creating a dependency cycle:

- **FileSystemService ↔ PathService**: FileSystemService needs PathService for path resolution, while PathService needs FileSystemService to check if paths exist
- **ParserService ↔ ResolutionService**: ParserService needs ResolutionService to resolve variables, while ResolutionService needs ParserService to parse content
- **StateService ↔ StateTrackingService**: Complex bidirectional relationship for state tracking and management

### Client Factory Pattern (Current Approach)

The primary approach for handling circular dependencies in Meld is the Client Factory pattern:

1. Create minimal client interfaces that expose only the methods needed by the dependent service
2. Implement factories to create these client interfaces
3. Inject the factories rather than the actual services
4. Use the clients to access only the functionality that's actually needed

This pattern follows the Interface Segregation Principle (the "I" in SOLID), ensuring that services depend only on the methods they actually use.

#### Example Implementation

For the FileSystemService ↔ PathService circular dependency:

```typescript
// Minimal interface for what FileSystemService needs from PathService
export interface IPathServiceClient {
  resolvePath(path: string): string;
  normalizePath(path: string): string;
}

// Factory to create a client for PathService functionality
@injectable()
@Service({
  description: 'Factory for creating path service clients'
})
export class PathServiceClientFactory {
  constructor(@inject('IPathService') private pathService: IPathService) {}
  
  createClient(): IPathServiceClient {
    return {
      resolvePath: (path) => this.pathService.resolvePath(path),
      normalizePath: (path) => this.pathService.normalizePath(path)
    };
  }
}

// Updated FileSystemService that depends on the factory
@injectable()
@Service({
  description: 'Service for file system operations'
})
export class FileSystemService implements IFileSystemService {
  private pathClient: IPathServiceClient;
  
  constructor(
    @inject('IPathOperationsService') private readonly pathOps: IPathOperationsService,
    @inject('PathServiceClientFactory') pathClientFactory: PathServiceClientFactory,
    @inject('IFileSystem') fileSystem: IFileSystem | null = null
  ) {
    this.fs = fileSystem || new NodeFileSystem();
    this.pathClient = pathClientFactory.createClient();
  }
  
  // Use the client interface directly
  private resolvePath(filePath: string): string {
    return this.pathClient.resolvePath(filePath);
  }
}
```
Similarly, implement the reverse direction with a  and .
    </DocsDevDiArchitectureMd>
    <DirectContainerResolutionAlternativeApproach>
For cases where the Client Factory pattern isn&apos;t feasible, direct container resolution with lazy loading can be used:
```typescript
import { resolveService } from '@core/ServiceProvider';

@injectable()
@Service({
  description: 'Service with lazy dependency resolution'
})
export class OutputService implements IOutputService {
  private resolverClient?: IVariableReferenceResolverClient;
  
  constructor(
    @inject('IStateService') private readonly stateService: IStateService,
    @inject('IResolutionService') private readonly resolutionService: IResolutionService
  ) {}
  
  /**
   * Get a resolver client using direct container resolution
   * This breaks circular dependencies by deferring resolution until needed
   */
  private getVariableResolver(): IVariableReferenceResolverClient | undefined {
    // Lazy-load the client only when needed
    if (!this.resolverClient) {
      try {
        // Get the factory from the container using ServiceProvider helper
        const factory = resolveService<VariableReferenceResolverClientFactory>(
          'VariableReferenceResolverClientFactory'
        );
        
        // Create the client
        this.resolverClient = factory.createClient();
        logger.debug('Successfully created VariableReferenceResolverClient');
      } catch (error) {
        logger.warn('Failed to create VariableReferenceResolverClient', { error });
      }
    }
    
    return this.resolverClient;
  }
  
  // Using the lazy-loaded client
  async convert(nodes: MeldNode[], state: IStateService, format: string = 'markdown'): Promise<string> {
    // Get the resolver only when needed
    const resolver = this.getVariableResolver();
    
    if (resolver && format === 'markdown') {
      // Process nodes using the resolver for field access
      return this.nodeToMarkdown(nodes, state, resolver);
    }
    
    // Fallback implementation if resolver isn't available
    return this.legacyConvert(nodes, state, format);
  }
}
```
This approach:
1. Avoids creating circular dependencies at initialization time
2. Loads dependencies only when they&apos;re actually needed
3. Provides fallback mechanisms when resolution fails
4. Uses the ServiceProvider helper  rather than direct container access
Key considerations when using direct container resolution:
1. Always include fallback mechanisms
2. Log resolution failures for debugging
3. Cache resolved instances for performance
4. Only resolve what you need, when you need it
      <BenefitsOfClientFactoryPattern>
1. **Clear Dependencies**: Services explicitly state what they need through focused interfaces
2. **Interface Segregation**: Services only get access to the specific methods they need
3. **No Null Checks**: Factory creates clients at initialization time, eliminating null checks
4. **Simpler Testing**: Small, focused interfaces are easier to mock
5. **Reduced Tight Coupling**: Services are coupled only to minimal interfaces
6. **Improved Code Readability**: Code intent becomes clearer when using direct method calls
7. **Better Maintainability**: Changes to service interfaces won&apos;t affect all dependent services
      </BenefitsOfClientFactoryPattern>
      <NamingConventions>
For consistency across the codebase, we follow these naming conventions:
- Client Interfaces:  (e.g., )
- Factory Classes:  (e.g., )
- Factory Methods:  for consistent API
      </NamingConventions>
      <TestingWithClientFactories>
Testing becomes more straightforward with the client factory pattern:
```typescript
describe('FileSystemService', () => {
  let context: TestContextDI;
  let service: IFileSystemService;
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    context = TestContextDI.create();
    
    // Create a mock client
    const mockPathClient = {
      resolvePath: vi.fn().mockReturnValue('/resolved/path'),
      normalizePath: vi.fn().mockReturnValue('normalized/path')
    };
    
    // Create a mock factory that returns our mock client
    const mockPathClientFactory = {
      createClient: vi.fn().mockReturnValue(mockPathClient)
    };
    
    // Register the mock factory
    context.registerMock('PathServiceClientFactory', mockPathClientFactory);
    
    // Resolve the service
    service = context.resolveSync('IFileSystemService');
  });
  
  afterEach(async () => {
    await context.cleanup();
  });
  
  it('should resolve paths using the path client', async () => {
    // Test that calling methods on the service uses the client correctly
    await service.readFile('some/path');
    
    // Verify the path client was used
    expect(mockPathClient.resolvePath).toHaveBeenCalledWith('some/path');
  });
});
```
For testing services that use direct container resolution, we register mocks directly with the container:
```typescript
describe('OutputService', () => {
  let context: TestContextDI;
  let service: IOutputService;
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    context = TestContextDI.create();
    
    // Create a mock resolver client
    const mockResolverClient = {
      accessFields: vi.fn().mockReturnValue('resolved value'),
      convertToString: vi.fn().mockReturnValue('formatted string')
    };
    
    // Create a mock factory that returns our mock client
    const mockFactory = {
      createClient: vi.fn().mockReturnValue(mockResolverClient)
    };
    
    // Register the mock factory with the container
    context.registerMock('VariableReferenceResolverClientFactory', mockFactory);
    
    // Resolve the service
    service = context.resolveSync('IOutputService');
  });
  
  afterEach(async () => {
    await context.cleanup();
  });
  
  it('should convert nodes to markdown with field access', async () => {
    const result = await service.convert(mockNodes, mockState, 'markdown');
    expect(result).toContain('formatted string');
  });
});
```
      </TestingWithClientFactories>
    </DirectContainerResolutionAlternativeApproach>
  </Context>
  <ExampleUsageScenario>
1. Input: A .meld file with lines like:@text greeting = "Hello"@data config = {
  "value": 123
}@import [ path = &quot;other.meld&quot; ]
2. We load the file from disk.
3. ParserService → parse the content → AST.
4. InterpreterService → interpret(AST).a) For each directive, DirectiveService → validation → resolution → update StateService.b) If an import is encountered, CircularityService ensures no infinite loops.
5. Once done, the final StateService has textVars.greeting = "Hello", dataVars.config = { value: 123 }, etc.
6. OutputService can generate the final text or an LLM-XML representation.
With DI, this flow is orchestrated through the container, which resolves all the required services and their dependencies automatically.
  </ExampleUsageScenario>
  <ErrorHandling>
• MeldDirectiveError thrown if a directive fails validation or interpretation.• MeldParseError if the parser cannot parse content.• PathValidationError for invalid paths.• ResolutionError for variable resolution issues.• MeldError as a base class for other specialized errors.• ServiceInitializationError for DI-related initialization failures.
These errors typically bubble up to the caller or test.
  </ErrorHandling>
  <Conclusion>
This codebase implements the entire Meld language pipeline:• Parsing Meld documents into an AST.• Validating &amp; interpreting directives.• Storing data in a hierarchical state.• Resolving references (text, data, paths, commands).• (Optionally) generating final formatted output.
The codebase uses TSyringe for dependency injection, which helps manage the complex relationships between services. The Client Factory pattern is used to handle circular dependencies between core services, with direct container resolution as an alternative for specific cases.
The test environment includes robust DI support with TestContextDI, allowing for isolated container testing, mock registration, and service resolution. The system adheres to SOLID design principles with interface-first design and clear separation of concerns.

<DependencyInjectionInMeld>
This document provides guidance on working with the dependency injection (DI) system in the Meld codebase.
  <Overview>
Meld uses [TSyringe](https://github.com/microsoft/tsyringe) for dependency injection. All services are registered and resolved through the DI container, which simplifies service initialization and testing.
  </Overview>
  <CoreConcepts>
    <1serviceRegistration>
Services are automatically registered with the DI container when they are decorated with the  decorator:
```typescript
import { Service } from '@core/ServiceProvider';

@Service({
  description: 'Service that provides file system operations'
})
export class FileSystemService implements IFileSystemService {
  // Implementation...
}
```
The  decorator registers the class with the container and adds some metadata for documentation purposes.
    </1serviceRegistration>
    <2dependencyInjection>
Services can inject their dependencies through constructor parameters:
```typescript
import { inject } from 'tsyringe';

@Service()
export class ResolutionService implements IResolutionService {
  constructor(
    @inject('IStateService') private stateService: IStateService,
    @inject('IFileSystemService') private filesystem: IFileSystemService,
    @inject('IParserService') private parser: IParserService,
    @inject('IPathService') private pathService: IPathService
  ) {}
  
  // Implementation...
}
```
    </2dependencyInjection>
    <3creatingServices>
Services should be created using the DI container, not with :
```typescript
// CORRECT: Let the DI container create the service
import { container } from 'tsyringe';
const service = container.resolve(ServiceClass);

// CORRECT: Use the ServiceProvider helper
import { createService } from '@core/ServiceProvider';
const service = createService(ServiceClass);

// INCORRECT: Don't use 'new' directly
const service = new ServiceClass(); // Avoid this
```
    </3creatingServices>
  </CoreConcepts>
  <BestPractices>
    <ServiceDesign>
1. **Interface-First Design**: Define an interface for your service before implementing it
2. **Explicit Dependencies**: Always specify dependencies in the constructor
3. **Private Injection**: Use  in constructor parameters to store the dependencies
4. **Explicit Return Types**: Always provide return types for methods
5. **Proper Initialization**: Services should be fully initialized after construction
    </ServiceDesign>
    <ExampleService>
```typescript
import { inject } from 'tsyringe';
import { Service } from '@core/ServiceProvider';

// 1. Define the interface
export interface IExampleService {
  process(data: string): Promise<string>;
  getStatus(): string;
}

// 2. Implement the service
@Service({
  description: 'Example service that demonstrates best practices'
})
export class ExampleService implements IExampleService {
  // 3. Constructor injection with explicit dependencies
  constructor(
    @inject('IDependencyService') private dependency: IDependencyService,
    @inject('ILoggerService') private logger: ILoggerService
  ) {}

  // 4. Explicit return type
  async process(data: string): Promise<string> {
    this.logger.log('Processing data...');
    return this.dependency.transform(data);
  }

  getStatus(): string {
    return 'Ready';
  }
}
```
    </ExampleService>
  </BestPractices>
  <TestingWithDi>
    <UsingTestcontextdi>
The  class provides utilities for testing with DI:
```typescript
import { TestContextDI } from '@tests/utils/di/TestContextDI';

describe('MyService', () => {
  let context: TestContextDI;
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Create a test context with DI
    context = TestContextDI.create();
  });
  
  afterEach(async () => {
    // Clean up resources
    await context.cleanup();
  });
  
  it('should process data correctly', async () => {
    // Register a mock dependency
    const mockDependency = { transform: vi.fn().mockReturnValue('transformed') };
    context.registerMock('IDependencyService', mockDependency);
    
    // Get the service from the container
    const service = context.container.resolve('IExampleService');
    
    // Test the service
    const result = await service.process('input');
    expect(result).toBe('transformed');
    expect(mockDependency.transform).toHaveBeenCalledWith('input');
  });
});
```
    </UsingTestcontextdi>
    <MockingServices>
To register mock implementations:
```typescript
// Register a mock instance
context.registerMock('IServiceName', mockImplementation);

// Register a mock class
context.container.registerMockClass('IServiceName', MockClass);
```
    </MockingServices>
  </TestingWithDi>
  <CommonPatterns>
    <DualModeConstructorPattern>
Meld services need to support both DI and non-DI modes. The recommended pattern is:
```typescript
/**
 * Constructor with DI annotations
 */
constructor(
  @inject(SomeFactory) factory?: SomeFactory,
  @inject('IService1') service1?: IService1,
  @inject('IService2') service2?: IService2
) {
  this.initializeFromParams(factory, service1, service2);
}

/**
 * Helper that chooses initialization path
 */
private initializeFromParams(
  factory?: SomeFactory,
  service1?: IService1,
  service2?: IService2
): void {
  if (factory) {
    this.initializeDIMode(factory, service1, service2);
  } else {
    this.initializeLegacyMode(service1, service2);
  }
}

/**
 * DI mode initialization
 */
private initializeDIMode(
  factory: SomeFactory,
  service1?: IService1,
  service2?: IService2
): void {
  this.factory = factory;
  this.service1 = service1;
  this.service2 = service2;
  // Additional initialization
}

/**
 * Legacy mode initialization
 */
private initializeLegacyMode(
  service1?: IService1,
  service2?: IService2
): void {
  // Create default dependencies
  this.factory = new SomeFactory();
  
  // Additional initialization
}
```
This pattern:
1. Keeps the constructor simple
2. Clearly separates DI and non-DI initialization logic
3. Makes maintenance easier
4. Preserves dual-mode functionality
5. Provides a clear path to eventually remove legacy mode
See  for more examples.
    </DualModeConstructorPattern>
    <FactoryPattern>
For services that need complex initialization or multiple instances:
```typescript
@Service()
export class ServiceFactory {
  constructor(
    @inject('IDependencyA') private depA: IDependencyA,
    @inject('IDependencyB') private depB: IDependencyB
  ) {}
  
  createService(config: ServiceConfig): IService {
    // Create a specialized instance with the given config
    // The factory can use its injected dependencies
    return new SpecializedService(this.depA, this.depB, config);
  }
}
```
    </FactoryPattern>
    <ServiceProviders>
For centralized service registration:
```typescript
// In a central di-config.ts file:
import { container } from 'tsyringe';

// Register core services
container.register('FileSystemService', { useClass: FileSystemService });
container.register('IFileSystemService', { useToken: 'FileSystemService' });
```
    </ServiceProviders>
  </CommonPatterns>
  <Troubleshooting>
    <CircularDependencies>
If you have circular dependencies, use  with a string token instead of a direct class reference:
```typescript
// Instead of this (can cause circular dependency issues):
constructor(@inject(DependentService) private dependent: DependentService)

// Do this:
constructor(@inject('IDependentService') private dependent: IDependentService)
```
    </CircularDependencies>
    <MissingDependencies>
If a service fails to resolve with &quot;unregistered dependency token&quot; errors:
1. Check that the service is decorated with 
2. Verify that the injected token is registered in the container
3. Check for typos in the injection token string
4. Make sure the services are imported and executed before use
    </MissingDependencies>
    <TestingIssues>
If tests fail with DI errors:
1. Use  to create a clean container for each test
2. Register all required mock dependencies before resolving the service
3. Clean up after tests with
```

# Meld Pipeline Flow

## Overview

The Meld pipeline processes `.mld` files through several stages to produce either `.xml` or `.md` output. Here's a detailed look at how it works:

  <TransformationModeAndVariableResolution>
When transformation mode is enabled, the pipeline handles directives and variables in a special way. Understanding this flow is critical for debugging and enhancing directive handlers:

```
    <KeyTransformationPipelineConcepts>
1. **Directive Handler Replacement Nodes**
- Directive handlers can return replacement nodes when in transformation mode
- The InterpreterService must properly apply these replacements in the transformed nodes array
- For import directives, the replacement is typically an empty text node
- For embed directives, the replacement node contains the embedded content
2. **State Propagation Across Boundaries**
- Variables must be explicitly copied between parent and child states
- When importing files, variables must be copied from imported state to parent state
- The ImportDirectiveHandler must ensure all variable types (text, data, path, commands) are copied
3. **Variable Resolution Process**
- Variables can be resolved at multiple stages:
- During directive processing
- During node transformation
- During final output generation
- During post-processing in the main function
- Meld supports two distinct architectures for variable resolution:
- **Traditional Architecture**: OutputService resolves variables directly during final rendering
- **Delegated Architecture**: OutputService delegates to ResolutionService for variable resolution
- Architecture is controlled by the  feature flag or the  environment variable
4. **State Management for Transformation**
- The StateService maintains both original and transformed node arrays
- Transformed nodes must be explicitly initialized
- The transformNode method is used to replace directive nodes with their outputs
- State must keep track of transformation options to determine which directives to transform

2.  **`@define` Documentation:** 



#### ../../_dev/DEFINE-CLARITY.md
```javascript
# @define Directive: Understanding and Implementation

## Core Concept: Creating Reusable Command Templates

The `@define` directive allows you to create named, reusable templates for runnable commands (both shell commands and language scripts). These templates can accept parameters, making them function like simple macros or functions within Meld.

Defined commands are invoked using the `@run $commandName(...)` syntax.

## Syntax

There are two primary forms:

**1. Defining Basic Commands (Shell Commands):**

```meld
@define commandName(param1, param2) = @run [command template with {{param1}} and {{param2}}]

// Or for multiline commands:
@define multiCmd(arg) = @run [[
  echo "Starting script with {{arg}}"
  ./run_script.sh {{arg}}
]]
```
- ****: The identifier (no @run $commandName(...)`.
- ****: An optional list of parameter names, acting as placeholders within the command template.
- ****: Separator.
- ** or **: The right-hand side **must** be a   directive. This defines the shell command template to be executed.
**2. Defining Language Commands (JS, Python, Bash):**
```meld
@define jsCommand(name, value) = @run js(name, value) [[
  // Raw JavaScript code using parameters name & value
  console.log(`Processing ${name}: ${value}`);
  // Note: {{variables}} are NOT interpolated here
]]

@define pyCommand(inputPath) = @run python(inputPath) [[
# Raw Python code
import sys
input_file = sys.argv[1]
print(f"Processing {input_file}")
# ...
]]
```
- ****: Identifier for the language command.
- ****: Parameters expected by the language script.
- ****: The right-hand side **must** be a   directive. This defines the language, the parameters it accepts, and the *raw code block* to be executed.
    </FileSystemServices>
  </ServiceResponsibilities>
  <CommandTemplateBodyForBasicCommands>
When defining a Basic Command template ( or ):
- **Shell Command**: It should be a valid shell command string.
- **Parameter Placeholders**: It can contain , , etc., corresponding to the parameters defined in the parentheses . These will be replaced by the arguments provided when the command is invoked via .
- **Other Variables**: It can also contain standard Meld variable references (, ). These are *not* resolved when  is processed; they are resolved *at the time the command is executed* via .
- **Multiline Syntax ()**: If using double brackets, the first newline immediately following  is ignored.
  </CommandTemplateBodyForBasicCommands>
  <LanguageCodeBlockForLanguageCommands>
When defining a Language Command template ():
- **Raw Code**: The content within  is treated as **raw source code** for the specified language (js, python, bash).
- **NO Interpolation**: Variables (, ) inside the  block are **NOT** interpolated. The code is passed directly to the language interpreter.
- **Parameters**: The parameters defined in  are passed to the script at runtime (e.g., as command-line arguments).
  </LanguageCodeBlockForLanguageCommands>
  <CoreImplementationDefinedirectivehandler>
The  handler primarily acts as a storage mechanism:
1. **Validate Syntax**: Checks the overall  structure.
2. **Extract Components**: Parses the directive to get the  (without parameters[
  "param1",
  "param2"
]@run` directive (its kind - basic or language, the command template string or code block, the language if applicable).
3. **Store Definition**: Creates a  object containing the  array and the necessary details from the  directive (e.g., the literal command template string for basic commands, or the language and raw code block for language commands).
4. **Update State**: Stores this  object in the current execution state using . Metadata can also be stored.
**Important**: The  handler does *not* execute anything or resolve variables within the template/code block. It simply stores the definition.
  </CoreImplementationDefinedirectivehandler>
  <InteractionWithRunCommandname>
The execution logic resides within the  and its  subtype:
1. **Invocation**: 
2. **Retrieve Definition**: Fetches the  for  from the state.
3. **Resolve Arguments**: Resolves the arguments (, ) provided in the  call.
4. **Execution based on Definition Type**:
- **If Basic Command Definition**: Substitutes the resolved arguments *positionally* into the stored command template string (replacing , , etc.). The resulting command string is then executed, resolving any other variables (, ) at that time.
- **If Language Command Definition**: Passes the resolved arguments to the stored language script (e.g., as command-line arguments  in Python,  in Node). The raw code block stored in the definition is executed by the appropriate language interpreter.
  </InteractionWithRunCommandname>
  <KeyImplementationAspectsConsiderations>
- **Positional Parameters**: Substitution/passing relies strictly on the order in the  parameter list and the  argument list.
- **Delayed Resolution (Basic Commands)**: Variables (, ) within a basic command template are resolved only when invoked via .
- **No Interpolation (Language Commands)**: The code block for language commands is executed raw; use the defined parameters to pass data into the script.
- **No Direct Output**:  only modifies state.
  </KeyImplementationAspectsConsiderations>
  <ValidationCriteria>
A correct  implementation ensures:
- Both basic and language command definitions are correctly parsed and stored.
- Invocation via  correctly retrieves the definition and identifies its type.
- Arguments passed to  are resolved correctly.
- For basic commands: Positional parameter substitution into the template works reliably, and the final command executes correctly.
- For language commands: Resolved arguments are passed correctly to the script, and the stored code block is executed by the correct interpreter.
```




3.  **Initial Draft Proposal:**

Reviewing your information about the Meld architecture and the `@define` directive, I'll now create a TypeScript type definition proposal that aligns with the system's design patterns and requirements.

```typescript
/**
 * TypeScript type definitions for the @define directive
 */

/**
 * Parameter metadata for command definitions
 * 
 * @remarks Includes position information for positional parameter substitution
 * and optional metadata for future extensibility.
 */
export interface ICommandParameterMetadata {
  /** Parameter name used in substitution patterns like {{paramName}} */
  name: string;
  
  /** Zero-based position in the parameter list */
  position: number;
  
  /** Whether the parameter is required (defaults to true) */
  required?: boolean;
  
  /** Optional default value if not provided at invocation time */
  defaultValue?: string;
  
  // TODO: Runtime validation for parameter name format (must be valid identifier)
}

/**
 * Base interface for all command definitions
 * 
 * @remarks Using a discriminated union pattern with 'type' field for better type safety
 * and IDE support, following Meld's existing patterns.
 */
export interface ICommandDefinitionBase {
  /** Command name used in @run $commandName(...) */
  name: string;
  
  /** Discriminator field for the union type */
  type: 'basic' | 'language';
  
  /** Array of parameter metadata */
  parameters: ICommandParameterMetadata[];
  
  /** Optional source location for error reporting */
  sourceLocation?: {
    filePath: string;
    line: number;
    column: number;
  };
  
  /** Optional visibility metadata */
  visibility?: 'public' | 'private';
  
  /** Optional description for documentation */
  description?: string;
  
  // TODO: Runtime validation for command name (must be valid identifier)
}

/**
 * Definition for basic shell commands
 * 
 * @remarks Basic commands are shell commands with parameter substitution.
 * The template can contain {{paramName}} placeholders and {{varName}} variable references.
 */
export interface IBasicCommandDefinition extends ICommandDefinitionBase {
  /** Discriminator value */
  type: 'basic';
  
  /** The shell command template with parameter placeholders */
  commandTemplate: string;
  
  /** Whether this is a multiline command (using [[ ]]) */
  isMultiline: boolean;
  
  // TODO: Runtime validation that commandTemplate contains valid parameter references
}

/**
 * Definition for language-specific script commands
 * 
 * @remarks Language commands contain raw code blocks executed by specific interpreters.
 * Parameters are passed to the script as arguments rather than substituted in the code.
 */
export interface ILanguageCommandDefinition extends ICommandDefinitionBase {

1. The  and  metadata fields will be valuable for documentation generation
2. The  interface aligns perfectly with our StateService storage needs
3. The execution context model provides all necessary dependencies for command invocation
  </AdditionalBenefits>
  <IntegrationWithStatecore>
These types will integrate well with our StateService implementation. They will allow us to:
1. Replace our current simple  type with the more robust 
2. Implement proper parameter validation when commands are defined
3. Provide more helpful error messages when command execution fails
4. Store and retrieve commands with proper type checking
  </IntegrationWithStatecore>
  <MinorSuggestions>
While the proposal is strong, I&apos;d suggest one small enhancement:
- Consider adding a  field to  to track when commands were defined, which would help with debugging and state tracking
  </MinorSuggestions>
  <Conclusion>
This type definition proposal meets and exceeds our requirements. It will significantly improve the robustness of the StateCore service and simplify our code by eliminating many runtime checks and type assertions. I&apos;m ready to implement these types in our service as soon as they&apos;re finalized.
Thank you for your thorough work on this proposal.

<ResponseToSystemArchitectFilesystemcoreTypeDefinitions>
Dear System Architect,
Thank you for the comprehensive type definition proposal for the  directive. I&apos;ve thoroughly reviewed your draft and am pleased with how it addresses the key concerns I outlined in my original request.
  <StrengthsOfTheProposal>
The discriminated union pattern with  and  provides exactly the type safety I was seeking for the FileSystemCore service. I particularly appreciate:
1. The  interface with position information, which will streamline our positional parameter substitution
2. The clear separation between basic shell commands and language commands
3. The inclusion of type guard functions (/) which will simplify conditional logic
4. The comprehensive  that includes all services needed for execution
  </StrengthsOfTheProposal>
  <AreasForEnhancement>
While the proposal is strong, I would suggest a few refinements to better support our implementation needs:
1. **Command Execution Results**: Could we add an  interface to standardize return values from command execution? This would help with consistency across the codebase and provide better error handling.
2. **Command Validation**: Perhaps add validation-related interfaces to support pre-execution validation, similar to what I proposed with  and .
3. **Error Types**: It might be helpful to define specific error types for command-related failures to improve error handling and reporting.
  </AreasForEnhancement>
  <ImplementationImpact>
Your proposal will significantly improve our implementation by:
- Eliminating numerous runtime type checks and conditional branches
- Providing clear interfaces for integration with StateService
- Enabling better IDE support and documentation
- Supporting a more robust validation pipeline
The  interface is particularly valuable as it will standardize how we store and retrieve command definitions, which was a key pain point in our current implementation.
I&apos;m ready to proceed with implementation based on these types, with the minor additions suggested above. Thank you for your thoughtful work on this proposal.

<ResponseToSystemArchitectRegardingDefineTypesProposal>
Dear System Architect,
Thank you for sharing your draft TypeScript type definitions for the  directive. I&apos;ve carefully reviewed your proposal against our requirements for the VariableResolution service.
  <OverallAssessment>
Your proposed type system is comprehensive and well-structured, with clear separation between basic shell commands and language-specific commands. The discriminated union pattern aligns well with Meld&apos;s existing architecture and will provide excellent type safety.
  </OverallAssessment>
  <StrengthsOfTheProposal>
1. The  interface with positional information will significantly help our parameter substitution logic
2. The distinction between  and  matches the actual behavior differences we need to support
3. The type guards (/) will simplify our conditional logic when processing different command types
4. The  provides all the necessary dependencies our service needs for resolution
  </StrengthsOfTheProposal>
  <SuggestedRefinements>
While the proposal is strong, I&apos;d like to suggest a few refinements specifically for variable resolution needs:
1. **Variable Resolution Context**: Since our service focuses on resolving  references, it would be helpful to add a  field to  that specifies when variables should be resolved (e.g., &apos;immediate&apos;, &apos;deferred&apos;, or &apos;none&apos; for language commands)
2. **Parameter Validation**: For our validation needs, consider adding a  utility function that returns any parameter names that don&apos;t follow identifier rules
3. **Resolution Tracking**: Add an optional  field to the base definition to help with debugging variable resolution issues
  </SuggestedRefinements>
  <ImplementationImpact>
These types will significantly simplify our code by:
- Eliminating manual type checking and casting
- Providing clear interfaces for interacting with the state service
- Enabling better error handling with specific error types
- Supporting both immediate and deferred variable resolution patterns
  </ImplementationImpact>
  <Conclusion>
The proposed type system meets our core needs and will help improve the reliability of the VariableResolution service. With the minor refinements suggested above, it will provide an excellent foundation for implementing robust variable resolution within command templates.
Thank you for your thoughtful work on this proposal. I look forward to implementing these types in our service.
