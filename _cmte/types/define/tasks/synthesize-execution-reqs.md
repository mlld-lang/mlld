# Synthesize Execution Requirements for '@run'

## Context

You are the **System Architect**. You have received feedback from component leads regarding the execution environment, runtime variable resolution, and state management related to the invocation of defined commands (originally defined by `@define`).

**CRITICAL NOTE:** Focus *only* on the requirements for the *runtime execution* when a `@run $definedCommand(...)` is encountered. Ignore the static type definitions of the directive itself for now.

### Feedback on Execution/Runtime:

# NOTE: Inputs adjusted for @define context

**ResolutionCore Feedback (Runtime Variable Usage):**

**StateCore Feedback (Command Definitions / Runtime State):**

**InterpreterCore Feedback (Execution Context):**

## Task: Synthesize Execution & Runtime Requirements

Review the provided feedback. Consolidate the requirements related *specifically* to the runtime execution of `@run $definedCommand(...)` directives.

*   Identify needs for the execution context when running the substituted command template.
*   Note requirements for resolving variables *within* the command template at runtime.
*   List requirements for retrieving the stored command definition and substituting parameters.

**Output Format:** Produce concise notes outlining the synthesized requirements for the `@run $definedCommand(...)` execution environment and runtime behavior.

### Synthesized Requirements: @run $definedCommand(...) Execution & Runtime

*   Requirement 1: (e.g., Parameter substitution must be positional...)
*   Requirement 2: (e.g., ResolutionService must handle `\{{var}}` and `$path` within the substituted command template...)
*   Requirement 3: (e.g., StateService needs efficient lookup for command definitions by name...)
*   (List other key execution/runtime requirements)
