# Review Draft '@{{ directiveName }}' Types Proposal - Response to Architect

## Context

You are the lead developer for the **{{ item.key }}** service.
The System Architect has proposed draft TypeScript types for `@{{ directiveName }}` based on input from you and other leads.

**CRITICAL NOTE:** The '@{{ directiveName }}' directive handles command execution (Basic, Language, Defined). Consider all subtypes relevant to your service.

Review the following:
1.  **Overall Architecture:** {{ overallArchitecture }}
2.  **`@{{ directiveName }}` Documentation:** {{ directiveClarityContent }}
3.  **Your Service Code (`{{ item.key }}`)**: {{ item.codeContent }}
4.  **Architect's Draft Type Proposal:**

{{ draft_spec }}

## Task: Respond to the Architect

Review the Architect's Draft Type Proposal (`{{ draft_spec }}`). Does it adequately address the needs previously identified for the `{{ item.key }}` service regarding `@run` directive handling (subtypes, parameters, execution context, command definitions)? Does it enable the code simplifications you hoped for?

**Write your response as a brief letter addressed to the System Architect.**

*   Acknowledge the proposal.
*   State clearly whether the draft meets the core needs outlined previously, particularly regarding code simplification for `@run` interactions.
*   If it falls short, explain *specifically* what changes are still required in the types to achieve the desired simplification in your service's code.
*   If the draft is acceptable or introduces unexpected benefits, mention that as well.
*   Keep the tone professional and constructive.
