# Response to Architect's Type Proposal for @define Directive

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for your comprehensive type proposal for the `@define` directive. I've carefully reviewed the proposed types against our requirements for the ResolutionCore service.

## Assessment

The proposed type definitions effectively address the core needs outlined in my original request, particularly:

1. **Discriminated Union Pattern**: The `ICommandDefinitionBase` with `type` discriminator and the specialized `IBasicCommandDefinition` and `ILanguageCommandDefinition` interfaces provide the type safety we need when processing different command types.

2. **Parameter Handling**: The `ICommandParameterMetadata` interface with position tracking will simplify our positional parameter substitution logic significantly.

3. **Command Registry Interface**: The `ICommandRegistry` interface aligns well with our StateService integration needs and will streamline command storage and retrieval.

## Additional Benefits

Your proposal introduces several benefits I hadn't explicitly requested but will greatly improve our implementation:

1. The type guards (`isBasicCommand` and `isLanguageCommand`) will simplify our conditional logic when processing commands.

2. The `ICommandExecutionContext` provides a clean way to pass all necessary services to command execution functions, which will improve our DI pattern usage.

3. The source location tracking in `ICommandDefinitionBase` will enhance our error reporting capabilities.

## Suggested Refinements

While the proposal is strong, I would suggest a few minor refinements:

1. Consider adding a `rawDirective` field to `ICommandDefinitionBase` to store the original directive text for debugging purposes.

2. For the ResolutionCore service specifically, it would be helpful to include a `resolveVariables` flag in `ICommandExecutionContext` to control whether variable resolution happens during command execution.

## Conclusion

The proposed types will significantly improve the ResolutionCore service's ability to handle `@define` directives and their execution via `@run`. The discriminated union pattern aligns perfectly with our DI architecture, and the detailed parameter metadata will simplify our variable resolution logic.

I'm ready to implement these types in our service and believe they will lead to more maintainable and robust code.
