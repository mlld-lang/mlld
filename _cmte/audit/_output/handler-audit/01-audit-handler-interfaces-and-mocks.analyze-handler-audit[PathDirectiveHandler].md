# PathDirectiveHandler Interface and Mock Usage Audit

## Summary

I've analyzed the `PathDirectiveHandler`, its interfaces, and test mocks to identify any discrepancies between interface definitions, handler implementation, and test mocks.

## Interface Analysis

### Interfaces Used by PathDirectiveHandler:
1. **IValidationService**
   - Methods: `validate`

2. **IResolutionService**
   - Methods: `resolveInContext`, `resolvePath`

### Handler Implementation Analysis

The `PathDirectiveHandler` (lines 30-177) implements the `IDirectiveHandler` interface and:
- Uses `IValidationService.validate` (line 65, commented out)
- Uses `IResolutionService.resolveInContext` (lines 79-83)
- Uses `IResolutionService.resolvePath` (lines 91-92)

## Test/Mock Usage Analysis

The test file creates these mocks:
- `validationService` mock (line 71) using `createValidationServiceMock()`
- `stateService` mock (line 72) using `createStateServiceMock()`
- `resolutionService` mock (line 73) using `createResolutionServiceMock()`

Mock setup:
- `validationService.validate` (expected in tests on lines 112, 124, etc.)
- `resolutionService.resolveInContext` (mocked on lines 107, 146)
- `resolutionService.resolvePath` (mocked on line 77)
- `stateService.setPathVar` (expected in tests on lines 115, 128)

## Discrepancies Found

### Interface Mismatches

1. **IResolutionService Interface**:
   - **Overloaded Method Signatures**: The `IResolutionService` interface has multiple overloaded definitions for methods like `resolvePath`, `resolveFieldAccess`, and `validateResolution`. This creates ambiguity about which signature is the canonical one.
   - **Deprecated Methods**: The interface contains deprecated methods (marked with `@deprecated`) that might confuse developers.

2. **Unused Interface Methods**: 
   - The handler only uses a small subset of the available methods from `IResolutionService` (2 of ~20 methods).
   - The handler doesn't use many of the methods from `IValidationService`.

### Mock Mismatches

1. **ResolutionService Mock**:
   - The mock implementation for `resolvePath` in the test factory returns a different structure than what's used in the test. The test creates a custom `createMockMeldPath` function (lines 64-82) instead of using the mock factory's return value.

2. **Type Mismatch in Mock Factory**:
   - In `createResolutionServiceMock()`, the `resolveFieldAccess` mock returns `{ success: true, value: 'resolved-field-access' }` which matches the `Result<T, E>` type, but the test doesn't use this method.

### Test Setup Issues

1. **Validation Service Expectations**:
   - The tests expect `validationService.validate` to be called (lines 112, 124), but the handler code has this call commented out (line 65).
   
2. **Inconsistent MeldPath Creation**:
   - The test creates a custom `createMockMeldPath` function (lines 64-82) to simulate the output of `resolvePath`, but this could get out of sync with the actual implementation.

3. **Test Reliance on Internal Implementation**:
   - The tests make assertions about internal implementation details like how the handler processes the path, which could make tests brittle if the implementation changes.

## Conclusion

The main issues are:
1. Interface definitions with multiple overloaded signatures creating ambiguity
2. A mismatch between validation expectations in tests and commented-out validation in the handler
3. Custom mock implementations in tests that could diverge from the factory-provided mocks

These discrepancies could lead to maintenance challenges as the codebase evolves, particularly if the interfaces change or if the commented-out validation code is restored.
