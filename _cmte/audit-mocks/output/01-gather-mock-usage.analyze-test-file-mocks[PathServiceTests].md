# Analysis of Mock Usage in PathService Tests

## TestContextDI Usage
- Uses `TestContextDI.createIsolated()` to create an isolated test container
- Properly calls `context.cleanup()` in `afterEach` to prevent container leaks
- Initializes the context with `await context.initialize()` after setup
- Context is correctly used to resolve the service under test with `context.resolveSync(PathService)`

## Mock Creation
- Creates manual mock objects for:
  - `IFileSystemServiceClient` with `exists` and `isDirectory` methods
  - `FileSystemServiceClientFactory` that returns the mock client
  - `IURLContentResolver` with methods for URL validation and fetching
- Creates a partial mock for `ProjectPathResolver` using constructor + spy approach
- Uses `vi.fn()` for all mock method implementations
- Mock implementations use appropriate return types (promises for async methods)

## Mock Registration
- Uses `context.registerMock(ProjectPathResolver, projectPathResolver)` for class instance
- Uses `context.registerMock('FileSystemServiceClientFactory', mockFileSystemClientFactory)` for factory
- Uses `context.registerMock('IURLContentResolver', mockUrlContentResolver)` for interface implementation
- After registration, manually assigns the file system client to the service: `service['fsClient'] = mockFileSystemClient`

## Spy Usage (vi.spyOn)
- Uses `vi.spyOn(projectPathResolver, 'getProjectPath').mockReturnValue(TEST_PROJECT_ROOT)` to mock a method on a real instance
- Correctly restores all mocks with `vi.restoreAllMocks()` in `afterEach`
- No other spies are used - most mocking is done via complete mock objects

## Complexities/Issues
- Manual assignment of `service['fsClient']` bypasses DI and directly modifies a private property
- The test doesn't verify the client factory was called - it manually sets the client
- Mocks are created before the service is resolved, which is good practice
- No type assertions are used on mock returns, which could lead to type mismatches
- No obvious TODOs or skipped tests

## Test Coverage
- Tests cover all main methods of `PathService`: `resolvePath`, `normalizePath`, `validatePath`, `validateURL`, `fetchURL`
- Each method has multiple test cases covering various scenarios (success, failure, edge cases)
- No skipped tests (no `it.skip` or `describe.skip` calls)
- Good validation of error conditions with proper error code checking

## Improvement Opportunities
- Use `context.registerMock('IFileSystemServiceClient', mockFileSystemClient)` instead of manual assignment
- Verify the factory was called to create the client rather than bypassing it
- Add type assertions for mock return values to ensure type compatibility
- Consider using `TestContextDI.setupWithMocks()` helper for more concise setup
- Test the circular dependency resolution pattern by verifying factory usage

Overall, the tests are well-structured with good coverage of functionality and error cases, but could better align with the DI architecture by testing how the service interacts with the factory pattern rather than bypassing it.
