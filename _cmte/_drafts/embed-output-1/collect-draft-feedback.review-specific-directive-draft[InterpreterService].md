# Response to System Architect Regarding EmbedTypes Proposal

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for the comprehensive type definitions for the embed directive functionality. I've reviewed your proposal thoroughly in the context of our InterpreterService implementation.

Overall, I find the proposed type system to be well-structured and it addresses the core needs of our service. The discriminated union approach for `EmbedSource` will significantly simplify our source detection logic, and the clear separation between source, range, and options makes the code more maintainable.

I particularly appreciate:
- The clear distinction between file and variable embedding through the discriminated union
- The comprehensive error handling with specific error types
- The structured `EmbedResult` that provides a consistent pattern for success and failure cases

The proposed types will enable us to refactor our current implementation to be more robust and type-safe, eliminating several conditional checks and improving error reporting.

One minor suggestion would be to consider adding a `transform` option in the `EmbedOptions` interface that could specify simple transformations like `lowercase`, `uppercase`, or `capitalize` to be applied to the embedded content. This would eliminate some custom code we currently maintain.

Thank you for your thoughtful work on this. We're ready to implement these types in the InterpreterService.

Regards,
Lead Developer, InterpreterService
