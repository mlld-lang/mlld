# Re: Draft TypeScript Types for Embed Functionality

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for the comprehensive draft TypeScript types for the embed functionality. I've reviewed the proposed types in detail and I'm pleased to report that they align well with our needs in the ParserService.

The discriminated union approach for `EmbedSource` will significantly simplify our source detection logic, eliminating the complex conditional checks we currently use. The clear separation between file and variable sources matches our implementation requirements perfectly.

I particularly appreciate:
- The comprehensive `EmbedOptions` interface that covers all our formatting needs
- The well-structured `EmbedRange` interface for partial content selection
- The detailed `EmbedError` type that will improve our error handling and reporting

The `EmbedResult` type with its success/failure discrimination will streamline our response handling, and the consistent pattern for error propagation will make integration with other services more straightforward.

One minor suggestion: In the `EmbedProcessor` interface, it might be helpful to add an optional context parameter to support future extensibility without breaking changes.

Overall, these types address our needs thoroughly and will enable the code simplifications I identified in my original request. I'm confident this will lead to more maintainable and robust code in the ParserService.

Thank you for your thoughtful work on this.

Regards,
Lead Developer, ParserService
