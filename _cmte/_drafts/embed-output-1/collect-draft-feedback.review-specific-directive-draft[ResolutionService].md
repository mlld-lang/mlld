# Response to System Architect

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for the detailed draft TypeScript types for the embed directive functionality. I've reviewed the proposal thoroughly in the context of our ResolutionService implementation.

The proposed types effectively address our "Variable Not Found" concerns by introducing a proper discriminated union for `EmbedSource` and a dedicated `EmbedError` type with specific error cases including `variable_not_found`. This will allow us to implement more precise error handling when variable references can't be resolved.

I particularly appreciate:

1. The clear separation between file and variable sources using the discriminated union pattern
2. The comprehensive `EmbedResult` type that handles both success and error cases consistently
3. The structured `EmbedError` type that will help us provide more informative error messages

These types will enable significant simplification in our resolution logic, allowing us to move away from complex conditional checks and toward more type-safe pattern matching, especially in the VariableReferenceResolver component.

One small suggestion: consider adding a `context` field to the `EmbedDirective` interface to allow passing resolution context information that might be needed for variable resolution in different scopes.

Overall, this proposal provides an excellent foundation for improving our error handling and code clarity. We can proceed with implementing these types in the ResolutionService.

Best regards,
Lead Developer, ResolutionService
