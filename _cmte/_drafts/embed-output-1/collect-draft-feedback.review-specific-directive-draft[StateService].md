# Response to System Architect

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for providing the draft TypeScript types for the embed directive functionality. I've thoroughly reviewed the proposal against our StateService implementation needs.

The proposed type system is well-structured and provides clear, type-safe interfaces that will significantly improve our code quality. The discriminated union approach for `EmbedSource` and the comprehensive `EmbedDirective` interface align perfectly with our requirements.

I particularly appreciate:
- The clear separation between file and variable sources
- The flexible range specification that will simplify our partial content embedding
- The robust error handling with specific error types
- The consistent result pattern that will make error propagation more predictable

These types will enable us to refactor the StateService to eliminate the complex conditional logic we currently use for source detection and error handling. The structured `EmbedResult` type will also streamline our response handling.

One minor suggestion: consider adding a `transform?: string | Function` property to the `EmbedOptions` interface to support content transformation before embedding, which could help with some of our more complex state transformations.

Overall, this proposal provides an excellent foundation for improving our codebase. I'm confident it will address our needs while maintaining the flexibility required across different services.

Sincerely,
Lead Developer, StateService
