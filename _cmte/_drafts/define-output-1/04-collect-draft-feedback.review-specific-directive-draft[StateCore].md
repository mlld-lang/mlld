# Response to System Architect RE: `@define` Directive Type Proposal

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for drafting the TypeScript types for the `@define` directive. I've reviewed your proposal thoroughly, and I'm pleased to say it addresses most of our core requirements while introducing several improvements I hadn't considered.

## Strengths of the Proposal

Your discriminated union approach with `BasicCommandDefinition` and `LanguageCommandDefinition` provides the type safety we need. The separation of concerns between command templates and parameters is well-structured, and the inclusion of metadata will be valuable for debugging and documentation.

I particularly appreciate:

1. The specialized `DefineDirectiveNode` interface, which will eliminate unsafe type casting in our handlers
2. The type guards (`isBasicCommand`, `isLanguageCommand`) that will simplify conditional logic
3. The utility functions for parameter substitution and command storage/retrieval

## Areas for Enhancement

While the proposal is strong, I'd like to suggest a few adjustments to better align with our implementation needs:

1. **Parameter Structure**: The current design uses string arrays for parameters. I'd recommend enhancing this to include position and validation information:
   ```typescript
   interface CommandParameter {
     name: string;
     position: number;
     required?: boolean;
     defaultValue?: string;
   }
   ```

2. **StateService Interface Extensions**: We need to update the `IStateService` interface with type-specific methods:
   ```typescript
   interface IStateService {
     // Existing methods...
     
     /**
      * Gets a command by name with type safety
      */
     getCommand<T extends 'basic' | 'language' = 'basic' | 'language'>(
       name: string, 
       type?: T
     ): T extends 'basic' 
       ? BasicCommandDefinition | undefined 
       : T extends 'language' 
         ? LanguageCommandDefinition | undefined 
         : CommandDefinition | undefined;
     
     /**
      * Type-specific command setters
      */
     setBasicCommand(
       name: string, 
       commandTemplate: string,
       parameters?: CommandParameter[],
       metadata?: CommandMetadata
     ): void;
     
     setLanguageCommand(
       name: string,
       language: string,
       codeBlock: string,
       parameters?: CommandParameter[],
       languageParameters?: string[],
       metadata?: CommandMetadata
     ): void;
   }
   ```

3. **Validation Function**: Adding a validation function that can be called during command registration would help prevent invalid commands from being stored:
   ```typescript
   export function validateCommandDefinition(def: CommandDefinition): void {
     // Implementation to validate command structure
   }
   ```

## Implementation Benefits

With these adjustments, we'll be able to:
1. Simplify the `@define` directive handler by leveraging the specialized types
2. Improve error messages by validating commands at registration time
3. Provide better IDE support through properly typed interfaces
4. Reduce runtime type checking in favor of compile-time safety

I believe these types will significantly improve code quality and maintainability in the StateCore service. The discriminated union pattern aligns perfectly with our needs for handling different command types.

Would you be open to incorporating these suggestions into the final type specification? I'd be happy to discuss implementation details further.

Sincerely,
Lead Developer, StateCore Service
