# Response to System Architect: FileSystemCore Define Types Proposal

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for the comprehensive draft TypeScript types for the `@define` directive. I've carefully reviewed your proposal against our FileSystemCore service requirements.

## Assessment

The proposed type definitions provide an excellent foundation for implementing the `@define` directive with proper type safety. The discriminated union pattern for `CommandDefinition` (with `BasicCommandDefinition` and `LanguageCommandDefinition`) directly addresses our need to differentiate between shell commands and language-specific commands.

## Strengths of the Proposal

1. The `DefineDirectiveNode` interface gives us a clear, typed structure for parsing directive nodes, eliminating unsafe type casting.
2. The utility functions (`substituteParameters`, `storeCommandDefinition`, `getCommandDefinition`) will standardize our approach to parameter handling.
3. The `CommandExecutionResult` interface aligns well with our service's execution result needs.
4. Type guards (`isDefineDirectiveNode`, `isBasicCommand`, `isLanguageCommand`) will simplify our conditional logic.

## Suggested Refinements

While the proposal is strong, I'd like to suggest a few refinements to better meet our FileSystemCore service needs:

1. **Command Execution Options**: Could we add a `CommandExecutionOptions` interface with properties like `cwd`, `env`, `timeout`, and `failOnError` to standardize execution options?

2. **Structured Command Execution**: To simplify our `executeCommand` method signature, could we add a `DefinedCommandExecution` interface that bundles `commandName`, `args`, and `options`?

3. **Language Support Type**: Consider making the language property in `LanguageCommandDefinition` a union type (`SupportedLanguage = 'js' | 'python' | 'bash'`) to provide compile-time validation of supported languages.

## Implementation Impact

With these types, we can significantly simplify our `executeCommand` method by:
- Adding proper overload signatures to handle both raw commands and defined commands
- Implementing strong parameter validation
- Providing better error messages with specific command types
- Reducing defensive coding around command structure

## Conclusion

The proposed types meet most of our core needs and will greatly improve type safety and code clarity in the FileSystemCore service. With the minor refinements suggested above, we'll have a comprehensive type system that fully supports our implementation requirements.

I'm excited to implement these types and appreciate the thoughtful approach to the design.

Best regards,

Lead Developer, FileSystemCore Service
