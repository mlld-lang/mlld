# Feedback on @define Directive Type Proposal

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for the comprehensive type proposal for the `@define` directive. I've reviewed it in detail against our implementation needs for the ResolutionCore service.

## Overall Assessment

The proposed type system is well-structured and addresses most of my core concerns. I particularly appreciate the discriminated union pattern for command definitions, which will significantly improve type safety in our codebase.

## Strengths of the Proposal

1. The `CommandDefinition` union type with clear discriminants will eliminate manual type checking
2. The specialized `DefineDirectiveNode` interface will reduce type casting in our parser
3. The utility functions like `substituteParameters` will standardize parameter handling
4. The type guards (`isDefineDirectiveNode`, `isBasicCommand`, etc.) will simplify conditional logic

## Suggested Refinements

While the proposal is strong, I'd like to suggest a few refinements:

1. **Command Resolution Context**: Consider adding a dedicated `CommandResolutionContext` that extends `ResolutionContext` with command-specific options like:
   ```typescript
   interface CommandResolutionContext extends ResolutionContext {
     commandOptions?: {
       captureOutput?: boolean;
       env?: Record<string, string>;
       cwd?: string;
       timeout?: number;
       errorMode?: 'throw' | 'return' | 'ignore';
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Command Reference Parsing**: A helper type for parsed command references would be valuable:
   ```typescript
   interface CommandReference {
     commandName: string;
     args: string[];
     originalReference: string;
   }
   ```

3. **Parameter Substitution Options**: I suggest expanding the `ParameterSubstitutionOptions` to include:
   ```typescript
   defaults?: Record<string, string>; // Default values by parameter name
   allowExtraArguments?: boolean;     // Whether to ignore extra args
   ```

## Implementation Impact

These types will significantly simplify our code by:
- Eliminating manual type checking and casting
- Providing clear contracts between components
- Standardizing error handling
- Enabling better IDE support and documentation

I'm particularly pleased with the utility functions which will help standardize how we store and retrieve command definitions from state.

## Conclusion

The proposal meets our core needs and will help us improve the ResolutionCore service. With the minor refinements suggested above, I believe we'll have a robust type system that will make our code more maintainable and less error-prone.

I look forward to implementing these types in our service.

Sincerely,

Lead Developer, ResolutionCore Service
