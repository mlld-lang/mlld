# Response to the System Architect

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for your comprehensive type proposal for the `@define` directive. I've reviewed it carefully against our implementation needs in the CoreDirective service.

## Assessment

Your proposal is excellent and addresses the core challenges we're facing with the current implementation. The discriminated union pattern for `CommandDefinition` provides exactly the type safety we need, and the separation between `BasicCommandDefinition` and `LanguageCommandDefinition` aligns perfectly with our two distinct command forms.

The `DefineDirectiveNode` interface will significantly improve our parsing and validation processes by providing clear structure and eliminating unsafe type casting. The utility functions (`substituteParameters`, `storeCommandDefinition`, `getCommandDefinition`) will standardize our command handling across the codebase.

## Implementation Benefits

Your proposal will enable the exact code simplifications I was hoping for:

1. The `DefineDirectiveHandler` will benefit from type narrowing, allowing us to handle each command type distinctly without complex runtime type checking.

2. The `RunDirectiveHandler` will be able to execute commands with proper type safety, reducing error-prone string manipulation.

3. The metadata support will improve our error reporting, which has been a pain point in debugging complex command definitions.

## Suggestions for Enhancement

While your proposal is strong, I'd like to suggest two minor enhancements:

1. Consider adding a `validateCommand` utility function that would check if a command definition is valid before storing it, potentially catching errors at definition time rather than execution time.

2. For the `LanguageCommandDefinition`, it might be helpful to add an optional `environmentVariables` field to support passing environment variables to language interpreters.

## Next Steps

I'm ready to implement these types in our service as soon as they're finalized. The type guards (`isDefineDirectiveNode`, `isBasicCommand`, `isLanguageCommand`) will be particularly useful during our transition period.

Thank you for addressing this need so thoroughly. This type system will significantly improve the maintainability and reliability of our `@define` directive implementation.

Lead Developer, CoreDirective Service
