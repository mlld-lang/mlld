# Response to System Architect: Review of @define TypeScript Types Proposal

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for the comprehensive type definition proposal for the `@define` directive. I've reviewed it carefully against our ContentResolution service needs.

## Overall Assessment

Your proposal excellently addresses the core needs outlined in my original request. The discriminated union pattern for `CommandDefinition` provides the clear separation between basic and language commands that was a primary concern for our service.

## Specific Strengths

1. The `BasicCommandDefinition` and `LanguageCommandDefinition` interfaces provide the strong typing I was seeking, with appropriate discriminants.

2. The inclusion of type guards (`isBasicCommand`, `isLanguageCommand`) will significantly simplify our code by eliminating manual type checking.

3. The `DefineDirectiveNode` interface with its nested structure matches the AST representation we need to work with, which will eliminate our unsafe type casting.

4. The utility functions (`substituteParameters`, `storeCommandDefinition`, `getCommandDefinition`) will standardize operations across our codebase.

## Additional Benefits

Your proposal includes several elements I hadn't explicitly requested but will be valuable:

1. The `CommandExecutionResult` interface provides a standardized way to handle command outputs.

2. The `ParameterSubstitutionOptions` interface offers flexibility we hadn't considered.

3. The detailed metadata support will improve our debugging capabilities.

## Implementation Considerations

As we implement these types, we'll need to:

1. Ensure the ContentResolver properly uses the type guards when processing nodes
2. Update our string literal handling to work with these more structured types
3. Extend our ResolutionContext to incorporate the command-specific properties

## Conclusion

This proposal meets and exceeds our requirements. The types are comprehensive, well-documented, and will significantly improve code safety and maintainability in the ContentResolution service. We're ready to proceed with implementation based on these definitions.

Regards,

Lead Developer, ContentResolution Service
