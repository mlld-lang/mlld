I've analyzed the feedback from all service leads and synthesized it into a comprehensive type system for file and import handling. Here's the final type specification that addresses the collective requirements:

```typescript
/**
 * Path Type Hierarchy
 * 
 * A system of branded types representing different states of path validation.
 * Each type guarantees certain properties about the path it represents.
 * 
 * @remarks Branded types were chosen over discriminated unions or class-based
 * implementations to provide compile-time type safety with minimal runtime overhead
 * while maintaining string compatibility with existing code. This was strongly
 * preferred by the PathService and FileSystemCore teams.

/** Path that has been validated against security constraints and exists */

 * Creates a raw path from a string.

  // Path normalization logic (replace backslashes, resolve .., etc.)
