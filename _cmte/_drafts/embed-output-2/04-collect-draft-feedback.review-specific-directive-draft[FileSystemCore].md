# Re: Review of Draft TypeScript Types for @embed Directive

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for the comprehensive type definitions proposal for the `@embed` directive. I've carefully reviewed the draft against our requirements and the FileSystemCore service implementation.

## Overall Assessment

The proposed type system is well-structured and addresses the core requirements for handling the three distinct embed types (path, variable, and template). The discriminated union pattern with explicit type guards will significantly improve type safety throughout our codebase.

## Specific Strengths

1. The `ResolutionContextFactory` is particularly valuable for our needs. It creates properly configured contexts for each embed type, which will eliminate the ad-hoc property checks currently scattered throughout our code.

2. The `VariableEmbedResolutionContext` with its explicit `disablePathPrefixing` and `preventPathPrefixing` flags directly addresses the path prefixing issues we've encountered with variable embeds.

3. The type guards (`isPathEmbed`, `isVariableEmbed`, `isTemplateEmbed`) will simplify our directive handler logic considerably.

## Implementation Impact

This type system will enable us to refactor the FileSystemCore service to:
- Replace complex conditional type checking with straightforward discriminated union handling
- Use the factory pattern for resolution contexts instead of manually configuring context objects
- Leverage compile-time type checking to catch potential embed type confusion errors

## Suggestions

While the proposed types are generally excellent, I would suggest:

1. Consider adding a `sourceLocation` property to the base interface to help with error reporting
2. It may be beneficial to include a `transformOptions` property for future extensibility

## Conclusion

The proposed type definitions meet our needs and will enable the code simplifications we identified. I approve this draft and look forward to implementing these types in our codebase.
