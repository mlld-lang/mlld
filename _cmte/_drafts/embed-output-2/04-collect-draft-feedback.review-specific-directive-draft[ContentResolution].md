# Response to System Architect

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for the comprehensive type proposal for the `@embed` directive. After reviewing the proposed TypeScript types against our architecture and implementation requirements, I find your draft to be well-structured and thoughtfully designed.

The discriminated union pattern with the `embedType` discriminator is particularly valuable, as it will significantly simplify our type checking in the ContentResolution service. The type guards (`isPathEmbed`, `isVariableEmbed`, `isTemplateEmbed`) will eliminate much of our current complex conditional logic for determining embed types.

I especially appreciate the `ResolutionContextFactory` class, which addresses a critical pain point in our current implementation. By providing specialized context factories for each embed type, we can ensure consistent configuration and eliminate the ad-hoc property checks that have been a source of bugs.

One specific improvement I'd like to highlight is the `VariableEmbedResolutionContext` interface with its explicit `disablePathPrefixing` and `preventPathPrefixing` flags. This directly addresses our issue with directory prefixing in variable embeds and will help prevent similar bugs in the future.

The proposal aligns perfectly with our needs for the ContentResolution service and will enable the code simplifications I identified. The clear separation between the three embed types (path, variable, and template) will make our handling logic more maintainable and less error-prone.

I'm ready to proceed with implementing these types in our service. Thank you for your thorough work on this proposal.

Regards,
Lead Developer, ContentResolution Service
