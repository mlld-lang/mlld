# Feedback on Embed Types Proposal

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for sharing your comprehensive draft of TypeScript types for the `@embed` directive. I've reviewed it thoroughly from the perspective of the VariableResolution service.

## Overall Assessment

The proposed type structure effectively addresses the core need to distinguish between the three embed types (path, variable, and template) and provides proper context handling for each. The discriminated union pattern with `embedType` as the discriminator is particularly valuable as it will eliminate much of the complex type checking currently required in our code.

## Specific Benefits

1. **Resolution Context Factory**: The `ResolutionContextFactory` with specialized methods for each embed type will significantly simplify our variable resolution logic. This directly addresses our issues with path prefixing in variable embeds.

2. **VariableReference Interface**: The consolidated interface for variable references with proper field access support aligns well with our current implementation and will make field access operations more type-safe.

3. **Type Guards**: The provided type guards will streamline conditional logic in our resolver code, replacing the current complex subtype determination logic.

## Implementation Impact

This type structure will allow us to refactor the `VariableReferenceResolver` class to:
- Remove the complex `determineSubtype` method
- Replace ad-hoc property checks with proper type guards
- Utilize the factory pattern for creating appropriate resolution contexts
- Ensure consistent handling of field access across all variable references

## Suggestions

Two minor suggestions to consider:

1. The `fieldPath` in `VariableReference` might benefit from using the `Field` type we already have defined (with `type: 'field' | 'index'` and `value: string | number`) for consistency with our existing field access implementation.

2. Adding a `strict` flag to the `ResolutionContext` interface would be helpful as this is a critical parameter that affects error handling in our resolution service.

I'm confident that implementing these types will significantly improve the reliability and maintainability of the variable resolution code. We're ready to proceed with the implementation based on this design.
