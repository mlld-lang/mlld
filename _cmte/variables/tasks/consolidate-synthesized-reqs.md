# Consolidate Synthesized Requirements for Variable Handling

## Context

You are the **System Architect**. Requirements for Meld's internal variable handling related to type structure, runtime resolution, and validation have been synthesized separately.

**CRITICAL NOTE:** Your goal now is to combine these synthesized notes into a final, pragmatic feature list for the draft specification for internal variable types.

1.  **Overall Architecture:** {{ overallArchitecture }}
2.  **Variable Handling Documentation:** {{ directiveClarityContent }}
3.  **Synthesized Variable Structure Requirements:**

{{ subtype_reqs }}

4.  **Synthesized Variable Resolution Requirements:**

{{ execution_reqs }}

5.  **Synthesized Variable Validation Requirements:**

{{ validation_reqs }}

## Task: Consolidate Final Features Pragmatically

Review the three sets of synthesized requirements provided above.

**Your goal is to combine these into a final, pragmatic list of desired features for the initial type spec draft for internal variable handling.**

*   **Integrate & Prioritize:** Combine the features from the three inputs, prioritizing those with the highest impact and alignment with architectural goals for variable management.
*   **Ensure Cohesion:** Make sure the combined features for structure, resolution, and validation work together logically.
*   **Resolve Final Conflicts:** Address any remaining minor conflicts between the synthesized notes.
*   **Explain Key Decisions:** Briefly document your reasoning for the final selection and prioritization.

**Output Format:** Produce concise notes outlining the *final consolidated* features and key decisions, ready to inform the drafting process for variable handling types. Use a simple bulleted list format.

### FINAL Feature Consolidation Notes for Variable Handling Draft

*   **Feature 1:** (e.g., Final decision on `MeldVariable` base interface and subtypes based on subtype_reqs)
*   **Feature 2:** (e.g., Key validation rules to implement from validation_reqs, like strict mode checks)
*   **Feature 3:** (e.g., Requirements for `ResolutionContext` based on execution_reqs)
*   **Rejected/Deferred Feature:** (Explain final decision)
*   (Continue listing key features for the draft)
