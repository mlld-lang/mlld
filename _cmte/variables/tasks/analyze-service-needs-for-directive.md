# Simplify {{ item.key }} Code with Stronger Variable Handling Types

## Context

You are the lead developer for the **{{ item.key }}** service.
The Meld language is improving its TypeScript type system for variable definition, resolution, and usage.

**CRITICAL NOTE:** This task focuses on the internal TypeScript types used for variable management within the Meld interpreter (e.g., state storage, resolution contexts), **not** necessarily the `@define` directive syntax itself, although they are related. Base your analysis on how variables are handled *internally* by your service.

Review the following:
1.  **Overall Architecture:** {{ overallArchitecture }}
2.  **Variable Handling Documentation:** {{ directiveClarityContent }}
3.  **Your Service Code (`{{ item.key }}`)**: {{ item.codeContent }}

## Task: Propose & Justify Variable Handling Type Improvements for Your Code

Examine your service's code (`{{ item.codeContent }}`) where it interacts with variable definition, storage, resolution, or usage.

1.  **Identify areas of complexity, manual validation, type casting, or edge-case handling in your code related to variable types or state.**
2.  **Propose specific TypeScript type features** (e.g., stricter types for variable values, better context types during resolution, clearer state interfaces) that would simplify or eliminate these complexities.
3.  **Crucially, make a clear case for *why* each proposed feature is needed.** Explain how it would tangibly benefit the {{ item.key }} service by making the code simpler, safer, or easier to maintain.
