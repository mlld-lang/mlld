# mlld v1.4.0 Recovery Status Document

## Overview
This document captures the current state of the mlld codebase after an agent accident caused partial loss of uncommitted changes during a major v1.4.0 architectural rewrite. Despite making commits, critical infrastructure pieces are missing or in an inconsistent state.

## Timeline
- **8dab0735**: Last known good commit - "fix: resolver prefix stripping and module extension handling"
- **7 hours gap**: Extensive work was done but not committed
- **ddb971e0**: "Integrate GitHubResolver with GitHubAuthService for secure token storage"
- **Agent accident**: Partial changes were made and then reverted
- **Current state**: Codebase is in an inconsistent state with CLI expecting new architecture but backend partially reverted

## What We Know Was Completed (from CHANGELOG.md v1.4.0)

### New Resolver Architecture
- Complete overhaul of how mlld loads files and modules
- Pluggable resolver system for extensible file/module loading
- Built-in resolvers: TIME, DEBUG, INPUT, PROJECTPATH, LOCAL, GITHUB, HTTP, REGISTRY
- Content type detection for proper handling of different file formats
- Private module support via GitHub and local directory resolvers
- JSON import support: `@import { key } from "./data.json"`

### New CLI Commands
- `mlld setup` - Interactive configuration wizard for resolvers and authentication
- `mlld alias` - Create path aliases for module imports
- `mlld auth` - GitHub authentication management (login/logout/status)
- `mlld env` - Manage allowed environment variables

### Private Modules
- GitHub resolver for private repositories with secure authentication
- Enhanced `mlld publish` with `--private` flag and custom `--path` support
- Path aliases map prefixes to local paths (e.g., `@shared/` → `../shared-modules`)
- Location-aware `mlld init` prompts to use configured module directories

### Environment Variables
- Access control via `mlld.lock.json` security settings
- Import allowed variables through @INPUT: `@import { API_KEY } from @INPUT`
- Manage with `mlld env allow/remove/list`

### Other Features
- Shadow Environments for @exec: `@exec js = { helperA, helperB }`
- Negation Operator for @when conditions: `@when !@variable => @action`
- Configuration moved from `mlld.config.json` → `mlld.lock.json`
- Resolver registry configuration with priority support
- Secure token storage using keytar (system keychain)

## Known Issues & Missing Pieces

### Critical Missing Infrastructure
1. **LockFile methods**: ✅ FIXED
   - `getResolverRegistries()` - Added to LockFile class
   - `setResolverRegistries()` - Added to LockFile class
   - These methods are now present and being used by CLI commands

2. **Configuration System**:
   - Migration from `mlld.config.json` to `mlld.lock.json` appears complete
   - CLI commands use new system, tests need updating
   - ConfigLoader still expects old format in tests

3. **Test Infrastructure**:
   - Tests written for old architecture need updating
   - Specific failures identified and understood

### All Tests Now Passing! ✅ (591 passed / 27 skipped)

#### Previously Fixed Issues:
- **Alias Command Test Failures** - Fixed by properly mocking LockFile and updating test expectations
- **ProjectPathResolver Context Behavior Tests** - Fixed by updating resolver to handle prefix-stripped references

### Fixed Issues ✅

#### ResolverManager Test Failures - FIXED
- Updated MockResolver to work with prefix stripping
- Fixed canResolve methods to handle stripped references
- All 12 ResolverManager tests now passing

#### ConfigLoader Test Failures - FIXED
- Updated test to use new config path: `~/.config/mlld/mlld.lock.json`
- All 20 ConfigLoader tests now passing

### What's Actually Working
- All new CLI commands exist: setup, alias, auth, env
- LockFile has all required methods
- ResolverManager prefix stripping is working correctly
- ConfigLoader using new paths correctly
- GitHubResolver integration with auth service is complete
- Test suite improved from 10 failures to 5 failures

## What Was Attempted to Fix

### By Previous Claude
1. Added missing `getResolverRegistries()` and `setResolverRegistries()` methods to LockFile class
2. Updated LockFileData interface to include `config.resolvers.registries`
3. Fixed resolver prefix stripping in ResolverManager (separate bug)

### By Agent (Then Reverted)
The agent created an entire dependency management system in `core/dependency/` which was then removed:
- TransitiveResolver.ts
- DependencyGraphBuilder.ts
- ConflictDetector.ts
- Modified LockFile.ts and ResolverManager.ts to integrate dependency tracking
- These changes were completely reverted

## Files Recently Modified
- `core/registry/LockFile.ts` - Missing methods added (uncommitted)
- `core/resolvers/ResolverManager.ts` - Fixed prefix stripping (committed)
- `cli/commands/setup.ts` - Uses new LockFile API but missing methods
- `cli/commands/alias.ts` - Same issue
- `cli/commands/auth.ts` - Potentially affected
- `cli/commands/env.ts` - Potentially affected

## Git Repository State
- Local branch is ahead of remote with rebased commits
- Several commits were skipped during rebase as already applied
- Working directory has uncommitted changes

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority
1. Commit the LockFile fix to restore basic functionality
2. Verify what's actually implemented vs what's documented in CHANGELOG

### Systematic Recovery Plan
1. **Audit CLI Commands**: Check each new command (setup, alias, auth, env) to understand what they expect
2. **Restore LockFile Infrastructure**: Implement all missing methods based on CLI usage
3. **Fix Configuration Migration**: Ensure mlld.lock.json structure matches what CLI expects
4. **Update Tests**: Fix test mocks and expectations for new architecture
5. **Verify Resolvers**: Ensure all documented resolvers (TIME, DEBUG, INPUT, etc.) are implemented

### Key Questions to Answer
1. What exactly was in the 7-hour work gap between commits?
2. Which parts of the v1.4.0 features are actually implemented vs just documented?
3. Is the configuration migration complete or partial?
4. Are all the resolvers listed in CHANGELOG actually implemented?

## Recovery Strategy
This isn't just missing methods - it's a partial revert of a major architectural change. The CLI was written for the new system but the backend infrastructure got reverted. We need to:

1. First stabilize - get tests passing with minimal changes
2. Then audit - understand what's actually implemented
3. Finally rebuild - systematically restore missing infrastructure based on CHANGELOG.md

## Files to Examine
- All files in `cli/commands/` to understand new API expectations
- `core/registry/LockFile.ts` for configuration structure
- `core/resolvers/` for resolver implementations
- `tests/` for understanding expected behavior
- Any `.lock.json` files for configuration examples
