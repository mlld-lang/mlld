Guards protect sensitive data. Labels track data provenance. Policies control capabilities. Needs declarations describe module requirements. Environments provide isolation and credential management for sandboxing agents.

**Reading order:** Start with `labels-overview` (foundations), then `security-policies` (declarative controls), `security-guards-basics` (expressive controls), and `env-overview` (execution contexts).

**MCP Security:** See `mcp` for setup, then `mcp-security` (automatic tainting), `mcp-policy` (policy restrictions), and `mcp-guards` (custom guards).
