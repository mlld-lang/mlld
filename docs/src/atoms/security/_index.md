Guards protect sensitive data. Labels track data provenance. Needs declarations control capabilities. Environments provide isolation and credential management for sandboxing agents.

**Reading order:** Start with `labels-overview` (foundations), then `security-policies` (declarative controls), `security-guards-basics` (expressive controls), and `env-overview` (execution contexts).

**MCP Security:** To secure MCP tools, start with `mcp-security` (automatic tainting), then `mcp-policy` (policy restrictions), and `mcp-guards` (custom guards). See `env-config` for profile-based tool availability.
