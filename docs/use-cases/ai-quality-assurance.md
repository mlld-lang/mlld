# Use Case: AI-Powered Quality Assurance

## The Challenge

Traditional QA is slow, expensive, and incomplete. Manual testing can't cover all scenarios, automated tests are brittle, and edge cases slip through. How can we build comprehensive, intelligent quality assurance?

## The Mlld Solution

```mld
@import { 
  testGenerator,
  bugPredictor,
  coverageAnalyzer 
} from @mlld/qa-intelligence

@import {
  runTests,
  measurePerformance,
  checkAccessibility
} from @company/qa-tools

# Analyze code changes
@text changes = @run [(git diff main...HEAD)]
@data affectedFiles = @run [(git diff --name-only main...HEAD)]

# Generate intelligent test cases
@text testCases = @run @testGenerator([[
  Generate comprehensive test cases for these changes:
  {{changes}}
  
  Consider:
  - Happy paths
  - Edge cases
  - Error conditions
  - Security implications
  - Performance impacts
  - Integration effects
]]) with {
  pipeline: [
    @validateTestCompleteness,
    @addRegressionTests,
    @prioritizeByRisk
  ]
}

# Predict potential bugs
@text bugAnalysis = @run @bugPredictor([[
  Analyze these changes for potential bugs:
  {{changes}}
  
  Based on:
  - Common bug patterns
  - Historical issues in similar code
  - Complexity metrics
  - Dependency impacts
]]) with {
  pipeline: [
    @crossReferenceWithHistory,
    @calculateRiskScores,
    @suggestPreventiveMeasures
  ]
}

# Generate test implementation
@exec generateTest(testCase) = @run @claude([[
  Implement this test case:
  {{testCase}}
  
  Using our testing framework:
  {{testingStandards}}
  
  Include:
  - Arrange/Act/Assert structure
  - Meaningful assertions
  - Good error messages
  - Cleanup code
]])

@data tests = @map @generateTest(@testCases)

# Run comprehensive quality checks
@data results = {
  unit: @run @runTests(@tests.unit),
  integration: @run @runTests(@tests.integration),
  performance: @run @measurePerformance(@affectedFiles),
  accessibility: @run @checkAccessibility(@affectedFiles),
  security: @run @securityScan(@changes)
}

# Synthesize results
@text qaReport = @run @claude([[
  Create a QA report from these results:
  {{results}}
  
  Include:
  - Overall quality score
  - Critical issues (must fix)
  - Warnings (should fix)
  - Suggestions (nice to have)
  - Risk assessment
]]) with {
  pipeline: [
    @formatAsActionableReport,
    @addFixSuggestions,
    @prioritizeByImpact
  ]
}

@add @qaReport
```

## Intelligent Regression Detection

```mld
# Build behavior model from existing tests
@data historicalTests = @run @analyzeTestHistory({
  timeframe: "last 6 months",
  includeFlaky: false
})

@text behaviorModel = @run @claude([[
  Build a behavior model from these test patterns:
  {{historicalTests}}
  
  Identify:
  - Core system behaviors
  - Critical user paths
  - Performance baselines
  - Integration points
]])

# Detect regressions
@exec detectRegression(change) = @run @claude([[
  Does this change break expected behavior?
  
  Change: {{change}}
  Expected behavior: {{behaviorModel}}
  
  Check for:
  - Functional regressions
  - Performance degradation
  - Breaking API changes
  - UI/UX inconsistencies
]]) with {
  pipeline: [
    @validateWithTests,
    @checkPerformanceImpact,
    @assessUserImpact
  ]
}

@data regressions = @map @detectRegression(@changes)

@when @regressions.hasCritical {
  @run @blockDeployment(@regressions.critical)
  @run @notifyDevelopers(@regressions.details)
}
```

## Visual Regression Testing

```mld
@import { captureScreenshots, compareVisuals } from @visual/testing

# Capture current state
@data screenshots = @run @captureScreenshots({
  pages: @affectedPages,
  breakpoints: ["mobile", "tablet", "desktop"],
  browsers: ["chrome", "firefox", "safari"]
})

# AI-powered visual comparison
@text visualAnalysis = @run @claude([[
  Analyze these visual differences:
  {{screenshots.differences}}
  
  Categorize as:
  - Intentional changes (expected)
  - Unintentional changes (bugs)
  - Improvements (better UX)
  - Regressions (worse UX)
  
  Consider:
  - Alignment and spacing
  - Color consistency
  - Text readability
  - Interactive elements
]]) with {
  pipeline: [
    @validateAgainstDesignSystem,
    @checkAccessibilityImpact,
    @assessUserExperience
  ]
}
```

## Exploratory Testing AI

```mld
# AI explores the application like a user
@exec exploreApp(persona) = @run @claude([[
  Explore the application as: {{persona.description}}
  
  Starting from: {{appUrl}}
  Goals: {{persona.goals}}
  
  Document:
  - Path taken
  - Issues found
  - Confusing elements
  - Missing features
  - Performance problems
]]) with {
  tools: [@browserAutomation, @networkMonitor, @consoleLogger]
}

@data personas = [
  { name: "New User", goals: ["Sign up", "Complete onboarding"] },
  { name: "Power User", goals: ["Advanced features", "Bulk operations"] },
  { name: "Mobile User", goals: ["Core tasks on phone"] },
  { name: "Accessibility User", goals: ["Navigate with screen reader"] }
]

@data explorations = @map @exploreApp(@personas)

# Find common issues
@text usabilityIssues = @run @synthesize(@explorations) with {
  pipeline: [
    @groupBySeverity,
    @identifyPatterns,
    @suggestFixes
  ]
}
```

## Performance Testing Intelligence

```mld
# Intelligent load testing
@text loadProfile = @run @claude([[
  Create a realistic load testing profile based on:
  
  Historical usage: {{analytics.usage}}
  User patterns: {{analytics.patterns}}
  Peak times: {{analytics.peaks}}
  
  Generate:
  - User scenarios
  - Traffic patterns
  - Geographic distribution
  - Device mix
]])

@data performanceTests = @run @loadTest(@loadProfile)

# Analyze results with AI
@text performanceAnalysis = @run @claude([[
  Analyze these performance test results:
  {{performanceTests}}
  
  Identify:
  - Bottlenecks
  - Scaling limits
  - Resource constraints
  - Optimization opportunities
  
  Compare with:
  - Previous benchmarks
  - Industry standards
  - Competitor performance
]]) with {
  pipeline: [
    @identifyRootCauses,
    @suggestOptimizations,
    @predictScalingNeeds
  ]
}
```

## Continuous Quality Learning

```mld
# Learn from production issues
@data productionIssues = @run @fetchBugReports({
  timeframe: "last 30 days",
  severity: ["high", "critical"]
})

@text learnings = @run @claude([[
  Extract QA improvements from these production issues:
  {{productionIssues}}
  
  For each issue:
  - Why wasn't it caught in QA?
  - What test would have found it?
  - How can we prevent similar issues?
]]) with {
  pipeline: [
    @generateNewTestCases,
    @updateQAChecklist,
    @improveTestStrategy
  ]
}

# Update QA pipeline
@run @updateQAPipeline(@learnings)
```
