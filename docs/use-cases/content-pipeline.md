# Use Case: Intelligent Content Pipeline

## The Challenge

Creating high-quality content requires multiple stages: research, writing, fact-checking, editing, formatting, and publishing. How can we build a pipeline that ensures consistency, quality, and brand alignment at scale?

## The Mlld Solution

```mld
@import { 
  researcher,
  writer,
  factChecker,
  editor,
  brandVoice 
} from @company/content-team

@import {
  seoOptimizer,
  readabilityScorer,
  plagiarismChecker
} from @content/tools

# Define content pipeline stages
@exec research(topic) = @run @researcher([[
  Research this topic comprehensively: {{topic}}
  
  Include:
  - Current state of knowledge
  - Recent developments
  - Expert opinions
  - Contrasting viewpoints
  - Relevant statistics
]])

@exec writeContent(research, brief) = @run @writer([[
  Write an article based on:
  
  Research: {{research}}
  Brief: {{brief}}
  
  Follow our content guidelines:
  - Engaging introduction
  - Clear structure
  - Evidence-based claims
  - Actionable conclusions
]])

@exec factCheck(content) = @run @factChecker([[
  Verify all claims in this content:
  {{content}}
  
  For each claim:
  - Mark as verified/unverified
  - Provide sources
  - Suggest corrections if needed
]])

@exec editContent(content, factCheck) = @run @editor([[
  Edit this content:
  {{content}}
  
  Fact check results:
  {{factCheck}}
  
  Focus on:
  - Clarity and flow
  - Grammar and style
  - Engagement and impact
]])

# Build the pipeline
@text topic = "The Future of AI in Healthcare"
@data brief = {
  audience: "Healthcare executives",
  length: "2000 words",
  tone: "professional but accessible",
  callToAction: "Schedule a consultation"
}

# Execute pipeline with quality gates
@text research = @run @research(@topic)

@text draft = @run @writeContent(@research, @brief) with {
  pipeline: [
    @ensureOriginalContent,    # No plagiarism
    @matchTargetLength,         # Right size
    @alignWithBrief            # Meets requirements
  ]
}

@text verified = @run @factCheck(@draft) with {
  pipeline: [
    @requireAllSourced,         # Every claim has source
    @validateSources,           # Sources are credible
    @updateWithCorrections      # Apply fixes
  ]
}

@text final = @run @editContent(@verified) with {
  pipeline: [
    @brandVoice.enforce,        # Consistent voice
    @seoOptimizer,              # Search optimized
    @readabilityScorer,         # Grade level check
    @finalQualityCheck          # Ready to publish
  ]
}

@add @final
```

## Multi-Format Publishing

Generate once, publish everywhere:

```mld
# Transform content for different platforms
@data platforms = [
  {
    name: "blog",
    formatter: @formatForBlog,
    requirements: { 
      images: true, 
      meta: true, 
      schema: "article" 
    }
  },
  {
    name: "linkedin",
    formatter: @formatForLinkedIn,
    requirements: { 
      length: 1300, 
      hashtags: 5,
      mention: "@company"
    }
  },
  {
    name: "twitter",
    formatter: @formatForTwitterThread,
    requirements: {
      chunks: 280,
      thread: true,
      visualize: "key points"
    }
  },
  {
    name: "email",
    formatter: @formatForNewsletter,
    requirements: {
      subject: "compelling",
      preview: "50 chars",
      cta: "prominent"
    }
  }
]

@exec formatContent(platform) = @run @platform.formatter(@final, @platform.requirements)

@data formatted = @map @formatContent(@platforms)

# Publish to each platform
@foreach item in @formatted {
  @write { 
    file: "publish/@item.platform/@topic.slug.@item.extension",
    content: @item.content
  }
}
```

## Personalization at Scale

```mld
@import { audienceSegments } from @marketing/segments
@import { personalizer } from @ai/content

# Create variants for different audiences
@exec personalizeContent(segment) = @run @personalizer([[
  Adapt this content for {{segment.name}}:
  {{final}}
  
  Audience characteristics:
  {{segment.profile}}
  
  Adjust:
  - Examples to be relevant
  - Language complexity
  - Cultural references
  - Call to action
]]) with {
  pipeline: [
    @preserveFactualAccuracy,
    @maintainBrandVoice,
    @validatePersonalization
  ]
}

@data variants = @map @personalizeContent(@audienceSegments)

# A/B test different versions
@foreach variant in @variants {
  @run @scheduleABTest(@variant, {
    segment: @variant.segment,
    metrics: ["engagement", "conversion", "shares"],
    duration: "2 weeks"
  })
}
```

## Content Intelligence Loop

Learn from performance to improve:

```mld
# Analyze content performance
@data performance = @run @analyzeMetrics({
  content: @published,
  timeframe: "last 30 days",
  metrics: ["views", "engagement", "conversions"]
})

# Extract insights
@text insights = @run @claude([[
  Analyze this content performance data:
  {{performance}}
  
  Identify:
  - What topics perform best
  - Which formats drive engagement
  - Optimal publishing times
  - Audience preferences
  
  Provide specific recommendations for improvement.
]]) with {
  pipeline: [@quantifyInsights, @prioritizeActions, @createEditorialCalendar]
}

# Update content strategy
@run @updateStrategy(@insights)

# Train pipeline components on successful content
@run @trainPipelineModels({
  successful: @performance.topPerformers,
  failed: @performance.underperformers
})
```

## Collaborative Review System

```mld
# Multi-stakeholder review process
@data reviewers = [
  { role: "legal", focus: "compliance and risk" },
  { role: "brand", focus: "voice and messaging" },
  { role: "product", focus: "accuracy and features" },
  { role: "sales", focus: "customer appeal and CTA" }
]

@exec requestReview(reviewer) = @run @notifyReviewer(@reviewer, {
  content: @final,
  deadline: @deadline,
  focusAreas: @reviewer.focus
})

@data reviews = @map @requestReview(@reviewers)

# Consolidate feedback
@text consolidatedFeedback = @run @claude([[
  Consolidate this feedback from multiple reviewers:
  {{reviews}}
  
  Create:
  - Unified list of required changes
  - Resolution for conflicting feedback
  - Priority order for changes
]]) with {
  pipeline: [@resolveConflicts, @maintainCoherence, @preserveQuality]
}

# Apply feedback
@text finalVersion = @run @applyFeedback(@final, @consolidatedFeedback)
```
