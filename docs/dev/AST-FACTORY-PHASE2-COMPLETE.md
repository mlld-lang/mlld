# AST Factory Pattern Implementation - Phase 2 Complete

## Summary

Phase 2 of the AST factory pattern implementation has been successfully completed. This phase focused on migrating client code to use the factory pattern directly, further improving the codebase's architecture and resolving circular dependencies.

## Completed Implementation

### Primary Changes

1. **VariableReferenceResolver Migration**
   - Updated `VariableReferenceResolver.ts` to inject and use `VariableNodeFactory` directly
   - Implemented graceful fallback to legacy functions for backward compatibility
   - Added proper error handling for factory resolution edge cases

2. **Test Suite Updates**
   - Modified `VariableReferenceResolver.test.ts` to test factory usage
   - Updated `VariableReferenceResolver.edge.test.ts` with factory mock
   - Updated `parent-object-reference.test.ts` to use factory pattern

3. **DI Container Registration**
   - Factory classes were already registered in `di-config.ts` during Phase 1
   - Tests now properly mock factory classes through DI container

4. **Factory Pattern Validation**
   - Verified all tests pass with the new implementation
   - Confirmed circular dependencies are successfully resolved
   - Maintained backward compatibility through transition period

### Implementation Details

1. **Factory Injection**
   ```typescript
   constructor(
     private readonly stateService: IStateService,
     private readonly resolutionService?: IResolutionService,
     private readonly parserService?: IParserService,
     @inject(VariableNodeFactory) private readonly variableNodeFactory?: VariableNodeFactory
   ) {
     // Fallback initialization for backward compatibility
     if (!this.variableNodeFactory) {
       this.variableNodeFactory = container.resolve(VariableNodeFactory);
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Factory Method Usage**
   ```typescript
   // Using factory for variable reference node creation
   const node = this.variableNodeFactory.createVariableReferenceNode(
     identifier, 
     valueType, 
     fields, 
     format, 
     location
   );
   
   // Using factory for type checking
   if (this.variableNodeFactory.isVariableReferenceNode(node)) {
     // Process node
   }
   ```

3. **Test Mocking Approach**
   ```typescript
   // Mock factory implementation
   mockVariableNodeFactory = {
     createVariableReferenceNode: vi.fn().mockImplementation(
       (identifier, valueType, fields, format, location) => ({
         type: 'VariableReference',
         identifier,
         valueType,
         fields,
         isVariableReference: true,
         ...(format && { format }),
         ...(location && { location })
       })
     ),
     isVariableReferenceNode: vi.fn()
   } as any;
   
   // Mock container resolution
   vi.spyOn(container, 'resolve').mockImplementation((token) => {
     if (token === VariableNodeFactory) {
       return mockVariableNodeFactory;
     }
     throw new Error(`Unexpected token: ${String(token)}`);
   });
   ```

## Verification

All tests are passing, confirming that:

1. The factory pattern implementation works correctly
2. Circular dependencies are resolved
3. Backward compatibility is maintained
4. Type safety is preserved through interfaces

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 3: Complete**
   - Continue updating other client code to use factories directly
   - Identify additional services that create AST nodes
   - Eventually remove legacy compatibility layer

2. **Additional Factory Implementations**
   - Implement factories for other node types
   - Continue to refine the factory API for better usability

3. **Documentation**
   - Update developer guidelines to emphasize factory pattern usage
   - Create examples and patterns for new code

## Conclusion

Phase 2 of the AST factory pattern implementation has successfully migrated key client code to use the factory pattern directly. This enhances the codebase architecture, improves maintainability, and resolves circular dependencies while maintaining backward compatibility.
