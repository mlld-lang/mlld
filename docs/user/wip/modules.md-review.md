Looking through Prior Claude's modules.md output against the syntax guide, I found several critical inaccuracies that need correction:

## Critical Syntax Errors

1. **Invalid import syntax with quotes for modules** (Line ~70):
   ```mlld
   /import { helper } from "./local-file.mld"
   ```
   Should be without quotes according to RULE_9:
   ```mlld
   /import { helper } from ./local-file.mld
   ```

2. **Invalid `/var @module` pattern** (multiple locations):
   The guide shows no evidence that `/var @module = {...}` creates exports. This appears to be invented syntax not supported by mlld.

3. **Non-existent `mlld-run` code blocks** (Line ~130):
   ```markdown
   ```mlld-run
   ```
   This syntax is not documented anywhere in the syntax guide and appears to be fabricated.

4. **Invalid shadow environment syntax** (Line ~280):
   ```mlld
   /exe js = { add, multiply }
   ```
   According to RULE_3 and EXE_EXECUTABLES, shadow environments use:
   ```mlld
   /exe js = {}
   ```

5. **Incorrect Node.js execution syntax** (Line ~300):
   ```mlld
   /var @result = run js {
   ```
   Should use `node` not `js` for Node.js according to the guide.

## Documentation Inaccuracies

6. **Lock file format** (Line ~350): The detailed JSON structure with gist URLs and integrity hashes is not documented in the syntax guide and appears speculative.

7. **DNS TXT record discovery** (Line ~340): This technical implementation detail is not mentioned in the syntax guide.

8. **Runtime dependencies frontmatter** (Line ~380): The `needs`, `needs-node`, `needs-sh` fields are not documented syntax.

## Required Changes

1. Remove or correct all quoted import paths for modules
2. Remove the `/var @module` export pattern entirely unless evidence exists in tests
3. Remove `mlld-run` code block references
4. Fix shadow environment syntax to match documented patterns
5. Correct Node.js execution examples  
6. Remove speculative lock file format details
7. Remove undocumented DNS discovery explanation
8. Remove undocumented frontmatter fields

The document needs significant revision to align with documented mlld syntax before it can be approved.
