## CODE TO ANALYZE

=== MOCK TO FIX ===

@cmd[cpai ../../../tests/**/*mock*.ts ../../../tests/**/*stub*.ts --stdout]

=== REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION ===

@cmd[cpai ../../../services/StateService/StateService.ts --stdout]

## YOUR TASK

For each mock implementation that needs fixing, provide a precise implementation:

1. For each critical missing or incorrect method:
   ```typescript
   {
     mockFile: string;
     methodName: string;
     currentImplementation: string;
     proposedFix: string;
     fieldsToHandle: string[];
     testImpact: string[];
   }
   ```

2. Implementation requirements:
   - Must handle all fields identified in method inventory
   - Must maintain transformation state correctly
   - Must match real service's deep/shallow copy behavior
   - Must preserve all type signatures

3. Provide exact code snippets that can be directly applied

BE PRECISE - these fixes will be applied directly to the codebase.
INCLUDE all necessary type imports and declarations.
ENSURE each fix addresses the specific test failures identified.
