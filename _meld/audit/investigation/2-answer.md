Response:
## StateService Mock Audit

Because the provided file references (“/Users/adam/dev/meld/_meld/audit/services/StateService/IStateService.ts”, “/Users/adam/dev/meld/_meld/audit/services/StateService/StateService.ts”, and any mock/stub test files) could not be read, there is currently no accessible code to analyze. In compliance with your requirement to avoid speculation and remain evidence-based, the findings below reflect the unavailability of the source files. Where code is missing, the analysis is necessarily incomplete.

Nonetheless, this report outlines the structure of the requested audit, indicating the exact information that would be captured and reported if the relevant code were accessible.

---

## 1. Complete Mock Inventory

| Mock Name       | File Path              | Methods Implemented         | Matches IStateService?       | Notes                         |
|-----------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| (No Data)       | (No Data)             | (No Data)                   | (No Data)                    | Source file not found         |

### Observations
- No mock/stub files were successfully read from the designated paths.  
- Without concrete file contents, it is impossible to list or compare any discovered mocks with IStateService.  

---

## 2. Mock Behavior Analysis

Because no mock implementations could be retrieved, the following sub-points illustrate the analysis that would normally be completed:

1. Checking clone() Implementation  
   - We would check if each mock implements a “clone()” method as defined by IStateService (or if the real interface includes that method).  
   - We would verify parameter usage, return types, and any transformation logic.

2. Transformation Mode Handling  
   - If the interface or real service uses transformation modes, we would confirm that each mock handles these modes accurately (e.g., “edit” vs. “view” transforms).

3. Return Types Verification  
   - We would ensure each mock method’s return type aligns with the expected return type in IStateService.

4. Simplified/Stubbed Behavior  
   - We would note any method that simply returns static values or incomplete data structures, which might cause test contradictions.

Since no code is available, none of these verifications can be performed at this time.

---

## 3. Mapping Mock Usage in Failing Tests

| Test File                | Mock Used        | Usage Description        | Status/Finding                          |
|--------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| (No Data)               | (No Data)        | (No Data)                | (No Data)                               |

### Observations
- No test files referencing StateService mocks were read successfully.  
- With no test data, we cannot map which mocks are used, how they are injected, or whether they contribute to failing test scenarios.  

---

## 4. Evidence and Code References

Below is how evidence would typically be presented if the code were available:

• File: “tests/services/MockStateService.ts”, Lines 45–52  
  ```ts
  // Example of how references and line numbers would appear:
  public clone(): IStateService {
      // mock logic
  }
  ```
• File: “tests/services/StateService.spec.ts”, Lines 10–12  
  ```ts
  // Example test usage referencing the mock
  const mockService = new MockStateService();
  expect(mockService.clone()).toBeDefined();
  ```

Because the files were not found or could not be read, we have no actual code snippets to display.

---

## Potential Architectural or Implementation Issues (Hypothetical)

If actual code were available, we would check for:

1. Inconsistent Parameter Definitions  
   - Mocks might have different parameters than the interface requires.  
2. Missing Methods  
   - Mocks might omit required IStateService methods entirely.  
3. Partial Implementations  
   - Some mocks might only implement a subset of methods or rely on placeholders.  
4. Contradictory Return Types  
   - A clone() method returning non-IStateService objects, for example.  

Without access to the actual code, these items remain purely hypothetical.

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Ensure All Source Files Are Accessible  
   - Verify the paths and permissions for “/Users/adam/dev/meld/_meld/audit/services/StateService/…” and any test mock/stub files.  
2. Re-run Audit with Correct File Paths  
   - Once you have the correct file references, reattempt reading the code to produce a detailed, evidence-driven report.  
3. Perform a Full Interface vs. Implementation Comparison  
   - After retrieving the files, systematically compare IStateService method signatures to each mock’s methods.  
4. Validate Test Coverage and Behavior  
   - Identify which mocks are used in failing tests and confirm that test logic is consistent with the real StateService interface.

---

## Conclusion

No usable code artifacts were found at the specified paths. Consequently, this audit cannot verify method signatures, implementations, or test behavior. For a complete, evidence-based analysis—complete with line-by-line references, mock-to-interface comparisons, and failing test mappings—the actual StateService interface, real implementation, and mock files must be accessible. Once those files are located and readable, this report structure can be filled with precise findings, code snippets, and references to the relevant lines.
