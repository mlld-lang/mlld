## CODE TO ANALYZE

=== MOCK IMPLEMENTATIONS ===

@cmd[cpai ../../../tests/**/*mock*.ts ../../../tests/**/*stub*.ts --stdout]

=== REAL IMPLEMENTATION ===

@cmd[cpai ../../../services/StateService/StateService.ts --stdout]

## YOUR TASK

Create a detailed mock coverage matrix focusing on transformation and state management methods:

1. For each mock implementation found, analyze critical methods:
   ```typescript
   {
     mockFile: string;
     mockName: string;
     criticalMethods: {
       clone: {
         implemented: boolean;
         matchesReal: boolean;
         differences: string[];
       };
       createChildState: {
         implemented: boolean;
         matchesReal: boolean;
         differences: string[];
       };
       enableTransformation: {
         implemented: boolean;
         matchesReal: boolean;
         differences: string[];
       };
       // ... other critical methods
     };
     testFiles: string[];  // Which test files use this mock
     testCases: string[];  // Names of test cases using this mock
   }
   ```

2. For each critical method NOT properly implemented in mocks:
   - Document exactly what behavior is missing
   - Note which tests might be affected
   - Suggest specific fixes needed

BE SPECIFIC about implementation differences.
INCLUDE line numbers for all findings.
FOCUS on methods that affect state management or transformation.
