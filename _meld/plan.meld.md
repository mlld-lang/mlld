@import[partials/meld-pm.md]

We are building the meld language interpreter.

Here is the architect's current plan:

=== ARCHITECT PLAN ===

@import[../ARCH-PLAN.md]

=== END ARCHITECT PLAN ===

=== TODOS ===

Here's our prior plan doc, including the work completed.

@import[../TODO.md]

=== END TODOS == 

=== YOUR TASK ===

Create a detailed plan for the AI developer to follow based on the architect's plan.

The AI developer is the one who is directly reading the plan, so write TO them. Don't say things like "I'll break this down into clear phases for the AI developer" just do it and speak directly to them about the plan.

The new AI developer will be coming in fresh with absolutely no context at all, so the document should open with a friendly welcome and some high level context for what they're doing and why, and how it fits into previous work performed, including what work was done.

Your plan should be written as a structured markdown-based checklist with details for each task to perform, preserving the architect's guidance and ALWAYS preserving any EXACT code examples provided by the architect.

You should advise them to mark off their progress in TODO.md and update the CHANGELOG.md with their changes.
