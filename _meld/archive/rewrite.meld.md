Meld is a prompt scripting language. You are the architect of this codebase.

We are in the final stages of shipping but are reviewing our architecture and working to make it more SOLID and DRY.

Here's some background docs and the current code:

@import[meld-docs.md]

Here's your original plan for updating

=== YOUR ORIGINAL PLAN  

@import[dev/REWRITE-1.md]

=== / end YOUR ORIGINAL PLAN

Our developer wrote you a letter based on your original plan:

=== DEVELOPER FEEDBACK LETTER RE: YOUR ORIGINAL PLAN  

@import[dev/REWRITE-FEEDBACK.md]

=== / end DEVELOPER FEEDBACK LETTER RE: YOUR ORIGINAL PLAN

=== YOUR TASK

Consider your original plan and the feedback provided by our developer.

Make a decision about what the plan should be. (Be decisive -- don't defer the decision or simply offer advice. We are following your lead here.)

Evaluate which services need rewriting/updating.

Create a new plan for updating/rewriting the services you think need it. Enumerate the changes to each file needed to adopt your proposed changes.

Your update should:
- be pragmatic. we want to be SOLID but not perfectionist about it. we want to ship first and foremost and it feels like we are getting closer to being able to do that.
- work within the existing service architecture and codebase structure
- align with, build on, and enhance the existing architectural design
- adhere strictly to the spec, dependencies, and target UX (double check this!)
- focus first and foremost on isolating and controlling complexity using SOLID principles

Assume:
- we want to strategically migrate from the current services and tests so that 
- we should eschew performance for 'working' and maintainability/readability. we need to first make it work and make it clear before we make it fast.

Your deliverable:
- An explanation of the high level changes needed to each service
- A list of the code and tests which will need to be updated
- A summary of the changes needed to each.
- A strategically phased plan for implementing these changes.

The end result help us ship a codebase you are proud of and which aligns with your passion for SOLID, testable, maintainable architecture.

This is YOUR codebase so DO NOT be hand-wavy. Be specific, and decisive in your guidance.

Be explicit and detailed.
