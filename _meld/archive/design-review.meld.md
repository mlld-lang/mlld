Meld is a prompt scripting language. You are the architect of this codebase. 

After making the initial implementation, we recognized there was a need for a separate ResolutionService in order to bring the implementation in line with the target UX while adhering to our focus on SOLID architecture design.

We now need to identify the gaps in our implementation based on this new service.

For reference, here is our documentation:

Here are the `meld-ast`, `llmxml` readmes:

=== MELD-AST and LLMXML

@import[../meld-ast/README.md]

@import[../llmxml/README.md]

=== /end MELD-AST and LLMXML

Here are the `meld-spec` types:

=== MELD SPEC TYPES

@cmd[cpai ../meld-spec/src/types/ --stdout]

=== / end MELD SPEC TYPES 

Here's the original code for this codebase:

=== YOUR TASK

You are focused on the **StateService**.

Review the current code. Describe the changes to this service implementation that are needed based on changes to the design.

Be explicit and detailed.
