# Future Vision: Comprehensive Error Testing System

## Introduction

This document outlines our vision for a comprehensive error testing system for the Meld language interpreter. While our current focus is on shipping an MVP with essential error handling (Phase 1), this document serves as a reference for future enhancements to our error testing capabilities in Phases 2 and 3.

## CLI Test Implementation Strategy

The CLI test file (`cli/cli.test.ts`) contains numerous tests that were previously marked with TODOs or comments indicating they were pending the new error system. For future comprehensive testing, we will implement them with the following strategy:

### 1. Categorize CLI Tests by Error Type

- **Fatal errors**: Syntax errors, missing files, etc.
- **Recoverable errors**: Undefined variables, field access issues, etc.
- **Warning errors**: Type coercion, expected stderr from commands, etc.

### 2. Implement Tests with Error Assertions

- For fatal errors: Verify that the CLI throws and exits with appropriate error code
- For recoverable errors: Verify that the CLI continues execution in permissive mode but throws in strict mode
- For warning errors: Verify that warnings are logged but execution continues in both modes

### 3. Test Error Context and Messages

- Verify that error messages contain useful context information
- Verify that error locations are correctly reported
- Verify that error messages are user-friendly and actionable

### 4. Test Error Handling Options

- Verify that `--strict` mode properly elevates recoverable errors to fatal
- Verify that `--silent` mode suppresses warnings but not errors
- Verify that `--verbose` mode provides additional error context

### 5. Test Error Recovery

- Verify that the CLI can recover from multiple recoverable errors
- Verify that state is consistent after error recovery
- Verify that output is still generated despite recoverable errors

## Error Testing Improvements

Based on our analysis of the current testing approach, we envision the following improvements to our error testing strategy for future phases:

### 1. Enhanced Test Environment Setup

- **Cross-Component Test Harness**: Develop a specialized test harness that can track error propagation across multiple components
- **Error Injection Points**: Define standard error injection points in each component to simulate various error conditions
- **Error Propagation Tracing**: Implement tracing mechanisms to verify the path of error propagation through the system
- **State Verification Utilities**: Create utilities to verify state consistency before and after error recovery

### 2. Specialized Error Testing Utilities

- **Error Scenario Generators**: Create utilities to generate complex error scenarios, including multiple errors, cascading errors, and timing-dependent errors
- **Error Context Validators**: Develop validators to ensure error context information is complete and accurate
- **Error Recovery Verifiers**: Implement utilities to verify that the system recovers correctly from errors
- **Error Performance Metrics**: Add tools to measure error handling performance and overhead

### 3. CLI-Specific Error Testing Framework

- **Console Output Capture**: Enhance our ability to capture and verify console output, including formatting, colors, and structure
- **Exit Code Verification**: Add utilities to verify that the CLI exits with the appropriate code based on error severity
- **User Interaction Simulation**: Implement tools to simulate user interactions during error conditions
- **Environment Variable Testing**: Create utilities to test error handling with various environment configurations

### 4. Edge Case and Stress Testing

- **Directive Nesting Generator**: Create a utility to generate deeply nested directive structures for testing
- **Circular Reference Detector**: Implement tools to verify that circular references are properly detected and reported
- **Large Document Processor**: Develop utilities for testing error handling with very large documents
- **Concurrent Error Generator**: Create tools to generate multiple concurrent errors to test system stability

### 5. Documentation and Training

- **Error Testing Patterns Guide**: Document common patterns for testing different types of errors
- **Component-Specific Testing Guidelines**: Provide specific guidelines for testing errors in each component
- **Error Handling Best Practices**: Document best practices for implementing error handling
