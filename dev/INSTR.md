# State Instrumentation Plan 

## Overview & Motivation

The goal of this instrumentation layer is to provide deep visibility into state transitions, transformations, and lifecycle events within Meld's state management system. This will help us:

- Debug state-related issues more effectively
- Understand complex state transitions
- Verify transformation behavior
- Support long-term maintenance
- Enable data-driven improvements

## Core Principles 

1. **Incremental Implementation** 
   - Start with critical operations (clone, transform)
   - Add capabilities progressively 
   - Maintain existing test stability
   - Allow gradual adoption 

2. **Backward Compatibility** 
   - Support existing test patterns 
   - Clear migration paths for legacy code 
   - Explicit removal targets 
   - Controlled deprecation process

3. **Testing First** 
   - Instrumentation must be thoroughly tested 
   - No degradation of existing test coverage 
   - Support for both old and new patterns during migration 

4. **Documentation & Clarity** 
   - Clear JSDoc for all new components 
   - Migration annotations for legacy code 
   - Explicit compatibility notes 
   - Usage examples and patterns 

## Guidelines 

### Documentation Standards 

1. New Components: 
```typescript
/**
 * @package
 * Tracks state lifecycle events and transitions.
 * 
 * @remarks
 * Core component of the state instrumentation system. Provides
 * event emission, history tracking, and debugging capabilities.
 * 
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const tracker = new StateLifecycleTracker();
 * tracker.onTransformation(event => {
 *   console.log(`Node transformed: ${event.context}`);
 * });
 * ```
 */
```

2. Migration-Targeted Code: 
```typescript
/**
 * @deprecated
 * Legacy state tracking implementation.
 * Will be removed once all tests use StateLifecycleTracker.
 * 
 * @see {@link StateLifecycleTracker} for the new implementation
 * @removal-target Phase 3 - Test Infrastructure Migration
 */
```

### Backward Compatibility 

1. **Identification** 
   - Mark legacy code with `@deprecated` 
   - Document replacement patterns 
   - Specify removal phase 
   - Track usage patterns 

2. **Migration Support** 
   - Provide migration utilities 
   - Support running in both modes
   - Clear upgrade paths 
   - Validation tools 

3. **Removal Process** 
   - Phase-specific removal targets 
   - Usage monitoring 
   - Explicit dependencies 
   - Clean migration paths 

### Testing Requirements

1. **Coverage Requirements** 
   - Full coverage of new components 
   - Migration utility testing 
   - Integration validation 

2. **Test Infrastructure** 
   - Support both old and new patterns 
   - Clear test utilities
   - Migration helpers
