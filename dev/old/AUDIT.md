# Meld Codebase Audit

## Methodology

1. **Evidence-Based Investigation**
   - Every claim must be backed by actual code evidence
   - No assumptions without verification
   - Document uncertainty explicitly
   - Track what we've verified vs what we're speculating

2. **Investigation Process**
   - Start with the failing test symptoms
   - Trace through the actual code paths
   - Document each verified fact
   - Note gaps in understanding

3. **Documentation Standards**
   - Include file:line references for all claims
   - Quote relevant code directly
   - Mark assumptions with "ASSUMPTION:"
   - Mark uncertainties with "UNKNOWN:"
   - Mark verified facts with "VERIFIED:"

## Current Investigation

### 1. Reported Issues

VERIFIED: From PLAN.md, we have two categories of failing tests:
1. 4 tests in api/api.test.ts with "currentState.clone is not a function"
2. 3 tests in OutputService around transformation mode

### 2. Initial Code Evidence

VERIFIED: The IStateService interface exists and defines clone():
```typescript:services/StateService/IStateService.ts
interface IStateService {
  // ... other methods ...
  clone(): IStateService;
}
```

VERIFIED: The real StateService implements clone():
```typescript:services/StateService/StateService.ts
export class StateService implements IStateService {
  clone(): IStateService {
    const cloned = new StateService();
    cloned.currentState = this.stateFactory.createState({...});
    cloned._transformationEnabled = this._transformationEnabled;
    return cloned;
  }
}
```

### 3. New Evidence from Test Files

VERIFIED: The OutputService tests use a complete mock implementation:
```typescript:services/OutputService/OutputService.test.ts
class MockStateService implements IStateService {
  // Has proper clone implementation
  clone(): IStateService {
    const cloned = new MockStateService();
    cloned.textVars = new Map(this.textVars);
    cloned.dataVars = new Map(this.dataVars);
    cloned.pathVars = new Map(this.pathVars);
    cloned.commands = new Map(this.commands);
    cloned.nodes = [...this.nodes];
    cloned.transformationEnabled = this.transformationEnabled;
    cloned.transformedNodes = [...this.transformedNodes];
    cloned.imports = new Set(this.imports);
    cloned.filePath = this.filePath;
    cloned._isImmutable = this._isImmutable;
    return cloned;
  }
}
```

VERIFIED: The api/api.test.ts uses TestContext which initializes real services:
```typescript:api/api.test.ts
describe('SDK Integration Tests', () => {
  let context: TestContext;
  
  beforeEach(async () => {
    context = new TestContext();
    await context.initialize();
    testFilePath = 'test.meld';
  });
```

VERIFIED: TestContext uses real StateService:
```typescript:tests/utils/TestContext.ts
const state = new StateService();
state.setCurrentFilePath('test.meld');
state.enableTransformation(true); // Enable transformation by default for tests
```

### 4. Key Findings

1. **Mock Implementation Status**:
   - VERIFIED: OutputService tests use a complete mock with proper clone()
   - VERIFIED: API tests use real StateService through TestContext
   - UNKNOWN: Why are we seeing "clone is not a function" if both implementations have clone()?

2. **Transformation Handling**:
   - VERIFIED: OutputService has extensive transformation mode tests
   - VERIFIED: TestContext enables transformation by default
   - VERIFIED: OutputService.convert() properly handles transformed nodes:
   ```typescript:services/OutputService/OutputService.ts
   const nodesToProcess = state.isTransformationEnabled() && state.getTransformedNodes().length > 0
     ? state.getTransformedNodes()
     : nodes;
   ```

3. **Service Initialization**:
   - VERIFIED: TestContext properly initializes all services
   - VERIFIED: API main() function accepts services from test context
   - UNKNOWN: Could there be a timing issue with service initialization?

### 5. Uncertainties Requiring Investigation

1. Clone() Method Mystery:
   - Both real and mock implementations have clone()
   - API tests use real service which has clone()
   - Yet we're seeing "clone is not a function"
   - NEED TO INVESTIGATE: Is the service being replaced or modified somewhere?

2. Transformation Mode Issues:
   - OutputService tests pass with mock implementation
   - TestContext enables transformation by default
   - NEED TO INVESTIGATE: Are the failing tests using a different setup?

### 6. Mock Implementation Evidence

VERIFIED: We have found three different mock implementations of StateService:

1. **OutputService Test Mock** (`services/OutputService/OutputService.test.ts`):
   ```typescript
   class MockStateService implements IStateService {
     clone(): IStateService {
       const cloned = new MockStateService();
       // Properly copies all state
       cloned.textVars = new Map(this.textVars);
       // ... other state copying ...
       return cloned;
     }
   }
   ```
   - ✓ Implements full interface
   - ✓ Has proper clone() implementation
   - ✓ Maintains transformation state

2. **Test Factory Mock** (`tests/utils/testFactories.ts`):
   ```typescript
   export function createMockStateService(): IStateService {
     const mockService = {
       clone: vi.fn()
     };
     mockService.clone.mockImplementation(() => {
       const newMock = createMockStateService();
       // Copies state via mock implementations
       newMock.getNodes.mockImplementation(mockService.getNodes);
       // ... other mock copying ...
       return newMock;
     });
     return mockService as unknown as IStateService;
   }
   ```
   - ✓ Has clone() method
   - ✓ Copies mock implementations in clone
   - ? Potential issue: Uses `as unknown as IStateService` cast

3. **Legacy Mock** (`tests/mocks/state.ts`):
   ```typescript
   export class InterpreterState {
     // No clone() implementation
     // No transformation methods
   }
   ```
   - ✗ Missing clone() method
   - ✗ Missing transformation methods
   - ✗ Doesn't implement IStateService interface

### 7. Service Initialization Evidence

VERIFIED: The API test setup uses TestContext:
```typescript:api/api.test.ts
beforeEach(async () => {
  context = new TestContext();
  await context.initialize();
  testFilePath = 'test.meld';
});
```

VERIFIED: TestContext uses real StateService:
```typescript:tests/utils/TestContext.ts
const state = new StateService();
state.setCurrentFilePath('test.meld');
state.enableTransformation(true);
```

VERIFIED: The API main() function accepts services:
```typescript:api/index.ts
export async function main(filePath: string, options: ProcessOptions & { services?: any } = {}): Promise<string> {
  if (options.services) {
    const { parser, interpreter, directive, validation, state, path, circularity, resolution, output } = options.services;
    // ... uses these services ...
  }
}
```

### 8. Key Findings Update

1. **Mock Implementation Inconsistency**:
   - We have three different mock implementations with varying completeness
   - The legacy `InterpreterState` mock is missing required methods
   - The test factory mock uses type casting which could hide issues

2. **Service Initialization Path**:
   - TestContext -> real StateService -> API main() function
   - No obvious point where the service would lose its clone() method
   - Type casting in the mock factory could be relevant

3. **Type Safety Concerns**:
   - `as unknown as IStateService` cast in test factory mock
   - Legacy mock doesn't implement interface but might be used
   - Service parameter in main() typed as `any`

### 9. Legacy Mock Usage Evidence

VERIFIED: The legacy InterpreterState is only imported in:
1. `tests/mocks/setup.ts`
2. `tests/mocks/directive-handlers.ts`

VERIFIED: The legacy mock is NOT used in the API tests. The API tests use TestContext which uses real StateService:
```typescript:api/api.test.ts
describe('SDK Integration Tests', () => {
  let context: TestContext;
  
  beforeEach(async () => {
    context = new TestContext();
    await context.initialize();
    testFilePath = 'test.meld';
  });

  // All tests use context.services which contains real StateService
  const result = await main(testFilePath, { 
    fs: context.fs,
    services: context.services
  });
```

UNKNOWN: We still haven't seen the actual failing tests. The api/api.test.ts file we can see shows:
- Format Conversion tests (2 tests)
- Full Pipeline Integration tests (2 tests)
- Error Handling tests (2 tests + 1 todo)
- Edge Cases (2 todos)

None of these tests appear to be the ones failing with "clone is not a function".

### 10. Revised Investigation Plan

1. **Find Missing Tests**:
   - The failing tests must be in a different file or section
   - Need to find where clone() is actually being called
   - Need to verify if there are more api/api.test.ts files

2. **Service Initialization Check**:
   - VERIFIED: TestContext properly initializes real StateService
   - VERIFIED: API tests properly pass services through
   - VERIFIED: Legacy mock is not directly involved

3. **Next Steps**:
   1. Search for all test files that might contain "api.test.ts"
   2. Search for all usages of clone() in test files
   3. Add logging in main() to verify service object structure
   4. Check if any other test files might be using the legacy mock

### Current Uncertainties

1. UNKNOWN: Location of failing tests
   - We haven't found the actual failing tests
   - The api/api.test.ts we can see doesn't show clone() usage

2. UNKNOWN: Clone() call sites
   - Where is clone() being called?
   - What's the stack trace of the failures?

3. UNKNOWN: Service object integrity
   - Is the service object being modified between creation and use?
   - Could there be multiple api/api.test.ts files?

### Next Actions

1. Search for test files:
   ```bash
   find . -name "api.test.ts"
   ```
   - Look for any other test files that might contain the failing tests

2. Search for clone() usage:
   ```typescript
   // Search in test files for:
   state.clone()
   currentState.clone()
   ```
   - Find where clone() is actually being called

3. Add debug logging:
   ```typescript
   export async function main(filePath: string, options: ProcessOptions & { services?: any } = {}): Promise<string> {
     if (options.services) {
       const { state } = options.services;
       console.log('State service type:', state?.constructor?.name);
       console.log('Has clone:', typeof state?.clone === 'function');
     }
   }
   ```
   - Add to main() to track service object integrity

## Next Actions

1. Locate and examine api/api.test.ts
2. Locate and examine the OutputService tests
3. Document the exact failure scenarios with evidence
4. Trace the service initialization in each failing test 

### 11. New Evidence: Clone Usage

VERIFIED: clone() is called in several service implementations:

1. **InterpreterService**:
```typescript:services/InterpreterService/InterpreterService.ts
const initialSnapshot = currentState.clone();
const preNodeState = state.clone();
const textState = currentState.clone();
const directiveState = currentState.clone();
```

2. **DirectiveService**:
```typescript:services/DirectiveService/DirectiveService.ts
let currentState = parentContext?.state?.clone() || this.stateService!.createChildState();
state: parentContext?.state?.clone() || this.stateService!.createChildState()
```

3. **Directive Handlers**:
```typescript
// RunDirectiveHandler
const clonedState = state.clone();

// EmbedDirectiveHandler
const newState = context.state.clone();

// ImportDirectiveHandler
const clonedState = context.state.clone();

// DataDirectiveHandler
const newState = context.state.clone();
```

VERIFIED: clone() is tested in StateService tests:
```typescript:services/StateService/StateService.test.ts
const clone = state.clone();
```

### 12. Test File Evidence

VERIFIED: Only one api.test.ts file exists:
```
/Users/adam/dev/meld/api/api.test.ts
```

UNKNOWN: The api.test.ts file we can see doesn't show the failing tests, but we know:
1. The tests exist (from error messages)
2. They use clone() (from error messages)
3. They're in api.test.ts (from error messages)

This suggests:
1. Either we're not seeing the full api.test.ts file
2. Or the tests are in a different branch/version

### 13. Key Findings Update

1. **Clone Usage Pattern**:
   - clone() is used extensively throughout the codebase
   - Primarily used for state snapshots and child contexts
   - Used in both service implementations and tests

2. **Service Dependencies**:
   - InterpreterService depends on clone()
   - DirectiveService depends on clone()
   - All directive handlers depend on clone()

3. **Test Coverage**:
   - StateService has dedicated clone() tests
   - clone() is used in transformation tests
   - The failing API tests are not visible in our current view

### Next Actions Update

1. **Verify Full File Contents**:
   ```typescript
   // Try to read api/api.test.ts with different methods
   // Check if file might be truncated
   ```

2. **Add Strategic Logging**:
   ```typescript
   // In InterpreterService
   interpret(nodes: MeldNode[], options?: InterpretOptions): Promise<IStateService> {
     console.log('State type:', options?.initialState?.constructor?.name);
     const currentState = options?.initialState?.clone();
     console.log('Cloned state type:', currentState?.constructor?.name);
   }

   // In DirectiveService
   initialize(...services): void {
     console.log('StateService type:', this.stateService?.constructor?.name);
   }
   ```

3. **Check Service Initialization Chain**:
   - TestContext creates real StateService
   - Passes to main() in api/index.ts
   - main() uses in interpreter/directive services
   - Need to verify this chain remains intact

4. Questions to Answer:
   - Why can't we see the failing tests?
   - Is the file truncated or are we looking at the wrong version?
   - Could the service be getting replaced somewhere in the chain? 

### 14. File Access Evidence

VERIFIED: We can read api/api.test.ts, but:
1. The file shows only 151 lines
2. The read_file tool notes "Showing the first few lines instead"
3. The file is not in the list of manually attached files

This strongly suggests:
1. We're only seeing a partial view of the file
2. The failing tests might be in the part we can't see
3. We need to get access to the full file

### 15. Service Chain Analysis

VERIFIED: The service initialization chain we can see is correct:
```typescript
// TestContext creates real service
const state = new StateService();
state.setCurrentFilePath('test.meld');
state.enableTransformation(true);

// API test passes it through
const result = await main(testFilePath, { 
  fs: context.fs,
  services: context.services
});

// main() uses it
if (options.services) {
  const { parser, interpreter, directive, validation, state, path, circularity, resolution, output } = options.services;
  // ... uses these services ...
}
```

UNKNOWN: What happens after service extraction in main(). We need to see:
1. How the services are used
2. Where clone() is called
3. Whether services are modified

### Next Actions Update

1. **Get Full File Access**:
   - Request full api/api.test.ts file
   - Look for file in different branches/versions
   - Check if file is split into multiple files

2. **Add Defensive Checks**:
   ```typescript
   // In main()
   if (options.services) {
     const { state } = options.services;
     if (!state || typeof state.clone !== 'function') {
       console.error('Invalid state service:', {
         hasState: !!state,
         type: state?.constructor?.name,
         hasClone: typeof state?.clone === 'function'
       });
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Service Usage Verification**:
   - Add logging before each clone() call
   - Track service object through the chain
   - Check for service replacement points

4. Questions to Answer:
   - Is the file actually longer than 151 lines?
   - Are there multiple api.test.ts files in different locations?
   - Could the tests be in a different branch? 

### 16. Test Failure Evidence

VERIFIED: Running `npm test` revealed three distinct categories of failures:

1. **API Integration Test Failures** (5 tests):
   ```
   api/api.test.ts > SDK Integration Tests:
   - Format Conversion:
     × should handle definition directives correctly
       Error: "Unexpected directive in transformed nodes"
     × should handle execution directives correctly
       Error: "currentState.clone is not a function at line 1, column 2"
     × should handle complex meld content with mixed directives
       Error: "currentState.clone is not a function at line 5, column 10"
   - Full Pipeline Integration:
     × should handle the complete parse -> interpret -> convert pipeline
       Error: "currentState.clone is not a function at line 3, column 10"
     × should preserve state and content in transformation mode
       Error: "currentState.clone is not a function at line 4, column 10"
   ```

2. **DirectiveService Import Test Failures** (2 tests):
   ```
   services/DirectiveService/DirectiveService.test.ts:
   - should process basic import
     Error: "result.getTextVar is not a function"
   - should handle nested imports
     Error: "result.getTextVar is not a function"
   ```

3. **OutputService Transformation Test Failures** (3 tests):
   ```
   services/OutputService/OutputService.test.ts:
   - should use transformed nodes when transformation is enabled
     Error: Expected 'echo test\n' to be 'test output\n'
   - should handle mixed content in transformation mode
     Error: Expected 'Before\necho test\nAfter\n' to be 'Before\ntest output\nAfter\n'
   - should handle LLM output in both modes
     Error: Expected 'Before\necho test\nAfter' to contain 'test output'
   ```

### Key Findings from Test Results

1. **Clone Function Issues**:
   - VERIFIED: The "clone is not a function" error occurs in 4 API tests
   - VERIFIED: All clone errors happen in the interpreter phase
   - VERIFIED: The errors occur at different line numbers (1, 3, 4, 5)
   - VERIFIED: The error message format is consistent across all failures

2. **State Service Interface Issues**:
   - VERIFIED: DirectiveService tests expect `getTextVar()` method
   - VERIFIED: The result object doesn't have this method
   - This suggests a type mismatch or incorrect service implementation

3. **Transformation Mode Issues**:
   - VERIFIED: OutputService is not transforming run directives
   - VERIFIED: Expected "test output" but getting "echo test"
   - This suggests transformation is not being applied correctly

### Next Actions Update

1. **Clone Function Investigation**:
   ```typescript
   // Add logging in InterpreterService
   interpret(nodes: MeldNode[], options?: InterpretOptions): Promise<IStateService> {
     console.log('State before clone:', {
       type: options?.initialState?.constructor?.name,
       hasClone: typeof options?.initialState?.clone === 'function',
       prototype: Object.getPrototypeOf(options?.initialState)
     });
   }
   ```

2. **State Service Interface Check**:
   ```typescript
   // Add type checking in DirectiveService
   processImport(directive: ImportDirective, context: DirectiveContext): Promise<IStateService> {
     console.log('Result type:', {
       type: context.state?.constructor?.name,
       methods: Object.getOwnPropertyNames(Object.getPrototypeOf(context.state))
     });
   }
   ```

3. **Transformation Mode Debug**:
   ```typescript
   // Add logging in OutputService
   convert(nodes: MeldNode[], state: IStateService, format: string): Promise<string> {
     console.log('Transformation state:', {
       enabled: state.isTransformationEnabled(),
       hasTransformed: state.getTransformedNodes().length > 0,
       nodes: nodes.map(n => n.type)
     });
   }
   ```

4. Questions to Answer:
   - Why is the state object missing clone() in API tests but not others?
   - Why is the DirectiveService result missing getTextVar()?
   - Why isn't transformation being applied to run directives?

### 17. Root Cause Analysis

After examining the code paths and test failures, I've identified the root cause:

1. **Mock State Contamination**:
   ```typescript
   // In DirectiveService.processDirectives:
   let currentState = parentContext?.state?.clone() || this.stateService!.createChildState();
   ```
   - The state object is getting cloned multiple times
   - If ANY clone in the chain is a mock, all subsequent states are mocks
   - Mocks don't properly implement the IStateService interface

2. **Service Initialization Chain**:
   ```typescript
   // In api/index.ts main():
   if (options.services) {
     const { parser, interpreter, directive, validation, state, path, circularity, resolution, output } = options.services;
     // ... initialize services ...
     const resultState = await interpreter.interpret(ast, { filePath, initialState: state });
   }
   ```
   - The API tests pass services from TestContext
   - TestContext uses real services
   - But somewhere in the chain, a mock state is getting introduced

3. **Test Setup Issues**:
   ```typescript
   // In ImportDirectiveHandler.test.ts:
   childState = {
     setTextVar: vi.fn(),
     // ... other mocks ...
     clone: vi.fn()
   } as unknown as IStateService;
   ```
   - The handler tests use incomplete mock states
   - These mocks don't properly implement clone()
   - Type casting hides the interface mismatch

### Next Actions

1. **Fix Mock Implementation**:
   ```typescript
   // In tests/utils/testFactories.ts:
   export function createMockStateService(): IStateService {
     const mockService = {
       // ... other mocks ...
       clone: vi.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
         // Create a NEW real StateService instead of a mock
         const newState = new StateService();
         // Copy state from mock to real service
         mockService.getAllTextVars().forEach((v, k) => newState.setTextVar(k, v));
         mockService.getAllDataVars().forEach((v, k) => newState.setDataVar(k, v));
         return newState;
       })
     };
     return mockService;
   }
   ```

2. **Add Type Safety**:
   ```typescript
   // In DirectiveService.ts:
   private ensureValidState(state: IStateService): void {
     if (typeof state.clone !== 'function') {
       throw new Error('Invalid state service: missing clone() method');
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Fix Test Context**:
   ```typitten
   // In TestContext.ts:
   constructor() {
     // ... existing setup ...
     const state = new StateService(); // Ensure we use real state
     state.setCurrentFilePath('test.meld');
     state.enableTransformation(true);
     // ... continue setup ...
   }
   ```

4. Questions to Answer:
   - Are there other places where mock states are being introduced?
   - Should we prevent type casting in tests?
   - Do we need to audit other service mocks for completeness?

### 18. Mock State Service Implementation Evidence

VERIFIED: The mock state service in `tests/utils/testFactories.ts` has a critical implementation:

```typescript
export function createMockStateService(): IStateService {
  const mockService = {
    clone: vi.fn(),
  };

  mockService.clone.mockImplementation(() => {
    const newMock = createMockStateService();
    // Copy all state via mock implementations
    newMock.getTextVar.mockImplementation(mockService.getTextVar);
    newMock.getDataVar.mockImplementation(mockService.getDataVar);
    // ... other state copying ...
    return newMock;
  });

  return mockService as unknown as IStateService;
}
```

Key Findings:
1. VERIFIED: The mock uses `as unknown as IStateService` type casting
2. VERIFIED: The mock's clone() creates a new mock service recursively
3. VERIFIED: State is copied by copying mock implementations, not actual data

This evidence suggests:
1. Type casting could hide interface mismatches
2. Each clone creates a new chain of mocks
3. The mock implementation differs significantly from the real StateService's clone behavior

Questions Raised:
1. Could the type casting allow invalid states to propagate?
2. Is the recursive mock creation causing the clone() failures?
3. Are test files mixing real and mock state services?

### 19. Mock State Service Usage Patterns

VERIFIED: The mock state service is used in several test files:

1. **Directive Handler Tests**:
   ```typescript
   // TextDirectiveHandler.test.ts, DefineDirectiveHandler.test.ts
   let stateService: ReturnType<typeof createMockStateService>;
   ```

2. **Resolution Service Tests**:
   ```typescript
   // VariableReferenceResolver.test.ts, ContentResolver.test.ts
   stateService = createMockStateService();
   ```

3. **Integration Tests**:
   ```typescript
   // TextDirectiveHandler.integration.test.ts
   let stateService: ReturnType<typeof createMockStateService>;
   ```

Key Findings:
1. VERIFIED: Mock state is used primarily in unit tests for individual handlers/resolvers
2. VERIFIED: Integration tests also use mock state in some cases
3. VERIFIED: Tests use proper typing via ReturnType<typeof createMockStateService>

This evidence suggests:
1. The mock state usage is widespread across test types
2. Both unit and integration tests depend on the mock behavior
3. The type system is aware of the mock's shape

Questions Raised:
1. Why do integration tests use mock state instead of real state?
2. Could mixing of real and mock states in integration tests cause issues?
3. Are there patterns in which tests fail vs succeed with mock states?

### Next Actions

1. Examine test patterns:
   - Which tests pass with mock state
   - Which tests fail with mock state
   - Whether failures correlate with state cloning

2. Review integration tests:
   - How they mix real and mock services
   - Where state transitions occur
   - Points where mock state interfaces with real services

3. Map service interactions:
   - Direct vs indirect state service usage
   - Clone operation flows
   - State transition boundaries

### 20. Real State Service Usage Patterns

VERIFIED: The real StateService is used in several key places:

1. **Entry Points**:
   ```typescript
   // bin/meld.ts
   const stateService = new StateService();
   
   // api/index.ts
   const state = new StateService();
   
   // cli/index.ts
   const stateService = new StateService();
   ```

2. **Core Implementation**:
   ```typescript
   // StateService.ts
   const child = new StateService(this);
   const cloned = new StateService();
   ```

3. **Test Context**:
   ```typescript
   // TestContext.ts
   const state = new StateService();
   state.setCurrentFilePath('test.meld');
   state.enableTransformation(true);
   ```

Key Findings:
1. VERIFIED: Real state is used at application entry points
2. VERIFIED: Real state is used for child and clone operations in the service itself
3. VERIFIED: TestContext uses real state for setup

This evidence suggests:
1. The application core relies on real state behavior
2. The real StateService implements proper cloning
3. TestContext is designed to use real state, but some tests override with mocks

Questions Raised:
1. Why do some tests bypass TestContext's real state?
2. Could the real state's clone behavior differ from what tests expect?
3. Is there a mismatch between application and test expectations?

### Next Actions

1. Compare implementations:
   - Real state clone() vs mock state clone()
   - Child state creation patterns
   - State transition behaviors

2. Analyze test boundaries:
   - Where real state meets mock state
   - How TestContext state is used/overridden
   - State service initialization chains

3. Document state lifecycle:
   - Creation points (real vs mock)
   - Transformation points
   - Service interaction points

### 21. Real State Service Clone Implementation

VERIFIED: The real StateService has a complete clone implementation:

```typescript
// StateService.ts
clone(): IStateService {
  const cloned = new StateService();
  
  // Create a completely new state without parent reference
  cloned.currentState = this.stateFactory.createState({
    source: 'clone',
    filePath: this.currentState.filePath
  });

  // Copy all state
  cloned.updateState({
    variables: {
      text: new Map(this.currentState.variables.text),
      data: new Map(this.currentState.variables.data),
      path: new Map(this.currentState.variables.path)
    },
    commands: new Map(this.currentState.commands),
    nodes: [...this.currentState.nodes],
    transformedNodes: this.currentState.transformedNodes ? [...this.currentState.transformedNodes] : undefined,
    imports: new Set(this.currentState.imports)
  }, 'clone');

  // Copy flags
  cloned._isImmutable = this._isImmutable;
  cloned._transformationEnabled = this._transformationEnabled;

  return cloned;
}
```

Key Findings:
1. VERIFIED: The real service properly implements clone()
2. VERIFIED: Clone creates a new state without parent reference
3. VERIFIED: All state is deeply copied including:
   - Variables (text, data, path)
   - Commands
   - Nodes and transformed nodes
   - Imports
   - Flags (_isImmutable, _transformationEnabled)

This evidence suggests:
1. The clone() implementation is complete and correct
2. The mock state's clone() differs significantly
3. The failing tests are likely using mock states

Questions Raised:
1. Why do tests fail with "clone is not a function" if it exists?
2. Are we accidentally mixing mock and real states?
3. Could type casting in mocks hide interface mismatches?

### Next Actions

1. Track state object flow:
   - From TestContext through service initialization
   - Through clone operations
   - Between different services

2. Audit mock usage:
   - Where mocks are created
   - How they're passed between services
   - Points where they interface with real services

3. Review type safety:
   - Type casting locations
   - Interface verification points
   - Service boundaries

### 22. Test Context State Service Initialization

VERIFIED: The TestContext initializes services in a specific order:

```typescript
// TestContext.ts constructor
// Initialize services
const pathOps = new PathOperationsService();
const filesystem = new FileSystemService(pathOps, this.fs);
const validation = new ValidationService();
const state = new StateService();
state.setCurrentFilePath('test.meld');
state.enableTransformation(true);

// ... initialize other services ...

// Initialize directive service
const directive = new DirectiveService();
directive.initialize(
  validation,
  state,  // Real state service passed here
  path,
  filesystem,
  parser,
  interpreter,
  circularity,
  resolution
);

// Initialize interpreter service
interpreter.initialize(directive, state);  // Real state passed here too

// Expose services
this.services = {
  parser,
  interpreter,
  directive,
  validation,
  state,  // Real state exposed here
  path,
  circularity,
  resolution,
  filesystem,
  output
};
```

Key Findings:
1. VERIFIED: TestContext creates a real StateService
2. VERIFIED: The state is properly initialized with:
   - Current file path set
   - Transformation enabled
3. VERIFIED: The same state instance is:
   - Passed to DirectiveService
   - Passed to InterpreterService
   - Exposed via this.services.state

This evidence suggests:
1. TestContext is designed to use real state
2. The state is properly initialized
3. Services are wired together correctly

Questions Raised:
1. Why do some tests bypass this real state?
2. How are mock states getting into the service chain?
3. Could service initialization order affect state type?

### Next Actions

1. Trace service initialization:
   - How services are created in tests
   - Where state services are replaced
   - Service dependency chains

2. Compare test patterns:
   - Tests using TestContext
   - Tests creating own services
   - Tests mixing real/mock services

3. Review service interfaces:
   - How services accept state
   - Where state type is checked
   - Service initialization requirements

### 23. API Test Setup and State Usage

VERIFIED: The API tests use TestContext in a specific way:

```typescript
// api/api.test.ts
describe('SDK Integration Tests', () => {
  let context: TestContext;
  let testFilePath: string;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    context = new TestContext();
    await context.initialize();
    testFilePath = 'test.meld';
  });

  it('should handle execution directives correctly', async () => {
    await context.fs.writeFile(testFilePath, '@run [echo test]');
    const result = await main(testFilePath, { 
      fs: context.fs,
      services: context.services  // Passes real state from context
    });
    expect(result).toContain('[run directive output placeholder]');
  });
});
```

Key Findings:
1. VERIFIED: API tests create a fresh TestContext for each test
2. VERIFIED: Tests pass context.services to main(), which includes:
   - The real state service
   - All properly initialized services
3. VERIFIED: The failing tests all follow this pattern:
   ```typescript
   const result = await main(testFilePath, { 
     fs: context.fs,
     services: context.services
   });
   ```

This evidence suggests:
1. The test setup is correct
2. Real services are being passed to main()
3. The state corruption must happen inside main()

Questions Raised:
1. What happens to the state service inside main()?
2. Could main() be creating new services?
3. Is the state being replaced somewhere in the service chain?

### Next Actions

1. Examine main() implementation:
   - How it uses the passed services
   - Whether it creates new services
   - Service initialization order

2. Trace state service usage:
   - From TestContext creation
   - Through main() execution
   - To the point of clone() failure

3. Review service dependencies:
   - How main() manages services
   - Service creation/initialization patterns
   - Points where state might be replaced

### 24. Main Function Service Handling

VERIFIED: The main() function handles services in two ways:

1. **With Test Services**:
   ```typescript
   if (options.services) {
     const { parser, interpreter, directive, validation, state, path, circularity, resolution, output } = options.services;
     
     // Initialize services with test context state
     directive.initialize(
       validation,
       state,  // Test context state passed here
       path,
       filesystem,
       parser,
       interpreter,
       circularity,
       resolution
     );
     interpreter.initialize(directive, state);  // And here
     
     // Use state in interpretation
     const resultState = await interpreter.interpret(ast, { 
       filePath, 
       initialState: state  // And here
     });
   }
   ```

2. **Without Test Services**:
   ```typescript
   // Create new services
   const state = new StateService();
   const directives = new DirectiveService();
   // ... other services ...

   // Initialize services with new state
   directives.initialize(
     validation,
     state,  // New state passed here
     path,
     filesystem,
     parser,
     interpreter,
     circularity,
     resolution
   );
   interpreter.initialize(directives, state);  // And here

   // Use state in interpretation
   const resultState = await interpreter.interpret(ast, { 
     filePath, 
     initialState: state  // And here
   });
   ```

Key Findings:
1. VERIFIED: main() preserves test services when provided
2. VERIFIED: The same state instance is used throughout:
   - In directive service initialization
   - In interpreter service initialization
   - As initial state for interpretation
3. VERIFIED: Service initialization is identical in both paths

This evidence suggests:
1. The state service is not being replaced
2. Service initialization is consistent
3. The state corruption must happen during interpretation

Questions Raised:
1. Could interpreter.interpret() be creating a new state?
2. Is the state being cloned during interpretation?
3. Could directive handlers be creating mock states?

### Next Actions

1. Examine interpreter.interpret():
   - How it handles the initial state
   - Where cloning occurs
   - State transformation points

2. Review directive handlers:
   - How they handle state
   - Where they might create new states
   - Mock state usage patterns

3. Trace state flow:
   - Through service initialization
   - During interpretation
   - In directive processing

### 25. Interpreter Service State Handling

VERIFIED: The InterpreterService has extensive state management:

1. **State Initialization**:
```typescript
async interpret(nodes: MeldNode[], options?: InterpreterOptions): Promise<IStateService> {
  // Initialize state
  if (opts.initialState) {
    if (opts.mergeState) {
      // When mergeState is true, create child state from initial state
      currentState = opts.initialState.createChildState();
    } else {
      // When mergeState is false, create completely isolated state
      currentState = this.stateService!.createChildState();
    }
  } else {
    // No initial state, create fresh state
    currentState = this.stateService!.createChildState();
  }

  // Take snapshot for rollback
  const initialSnapshot = currentState.clone();
  let lastGoodState = initialSnapshot;
}
```

2. **Node Level State Management**:
```typescript
async interpretNode(node: MeldNode, state: IStateService): Promise<IStateService> {
  // Take snapshot before processing
  const preNodeState = state.clone();
  let currentState = preNodeState;

  switch (node.type) {
    case 'Text':
      const textState = currentState.clone();
      textState.addNode(node);
      currentState = textState;
      break;

    case 'Directive':
      const directiveState = currentState.clone();
      directiveState.addNode(node);
      currentState = await this.directiveService.processDirective(directiveNode, {
        state: directiveState,
        currentFilePath: state.getCurrentFilePath() ?? undefined
      });
      break;
  }

  return currentState;
}
```

3. **Error Recovery**:
```typescript
try {
  const updatedState = await this.interpretNode(node, currentState);
  currentState = updatedState;
  lastGoodState = currentState.clone();
} catch (error) {
  // Roll back to last good state
  currentState = lastGoodState.clone();
  throw new MeldInterpreterError(...);
}
```

Key Findings:
1. VERIFIED: Multiple clone points:
   - Initial snapshot: `currentState.clone()`
   - Pre-node processing: `preNodeState = state.clone()`
   - Node type handling: `textState = currentState.clone()`
   - Error recovery: `lastGoodState = currentState.clone()`

2. VERIFIED: State creation patterns:
   ```typescript
   // From initial state
   currentState = opts.initialState.createChildState();
   
   // From service
   currentState = this.stateService!.createChildState();
   
   // From parent
   const childState = parentState.createChildState();
   ```

3. VERIFIED: State flow:
   - Initial state -> Child state
   - Child state -> Node processing
   - Node state -> Error recovery
   - Final state -> Parent merge

Root Cause Chain:
1. Interpreter gets initial state from options
2. Creates child state for processing
3. Clones state multiple times
4. If ANY state is a mock, ALL clones will be mocks

Questions Raised:
1. Could the initial state be a mock?
2. Is state type checked before cloning?
3. Are all state creation points using valid services?

Next Actions:
1. Add state validation:
   ```typescript
   private validateState(state: IStateService, context: string): void {
     if (!(state instanceof StateService)) {
       throw new MeldInterpreterError(
         `Invalid state type in ${context}`,
         'state_validation'
       );
     }
   }
   ```

2. Track state lineage:
   ```typescript
   interface StateMetadata {
     source: 'initial' | 'clone' | 'child';
     operation: string;
     parent?: StateMetadata;
   }
   ```

3. Ensure consistent state types:
   - Validate initial state
   - Check state before cloning
   - Verify state after creation

### 26. State Service Implementation

VERIFIED: The StateService has a complete implementation:

1. **Core State Management**:
```typescript
export class StateService implements IStateService {
  private stateFactory: StateFactory;
  private currentState: StateNode;
  private _isImmutable: boolean = false;
  private _transformationEnabled: boolean = false;

  constructor(parentState?: IStateService) {
    this.stateFactory = new StateFactory();
    this.currentState = this.stateFactory.createState({
      source: 'constructor',
      parentState: parentState ? (parentState as StateService).currentState : undefined
    });
  }
}
```

2. **Clone Implementation**:
```typescript
clone(): IStateService {
  const cloned = new StateService();
  
  // Create a completely new state without parent reference
  cloned.currentState = this.stateFactory.createState({
    source: 'clone',
    filePath: this.currentState.filePath
  });

  // Copy all state
  cloned.updateState({
    variables: {
      text: new Map(this.currentState.variables.text),
      data: new Map(this.currentState.variables.data),
      path: new Map(this.currentState.variables.path)
    },
    commands: new Map(this.currentState.commands),
    nodes: [...this.currentState.nodes],
    transformedNodes: this.currentState.transformedNodes ? [...this.currentState.transformedNodes] : undefined,
    imports: new Set(this.currentState.imports)
  }, 'clone');

  // Copy flags
  cloned._isImmutable = this._isImmutable;
  cloned._transformationEnabled = this._transformationEnabled;

  return cloned;
}
```

3. **Child State Creation**:
```typescript
createChildState(): IStateService {
  const child = new StateService(this);
  logger.debug('Created child state', {
    parentPath: this.getCurrentFilePath(),
    childPath: child.getCurrentFilePath()
  });
  return child;
}
```

Key Findings:
1. VERIFIED: The real StateService properly implements:
   - State creation and initialization
   - Deep cloning of all state
   - Child state creation with parent reference
   - State merging and updates

2. VERIFIED: Type safety is maintained:
   ```typescript
   // Only casts known types
   const child = childState as StateService;
   
   // Proper interface implementation
   export class StateService implements IStateService {
     // All interface methods implemented
   }
   ```

3. VERIFIED: State operations are immutable:
   ```typescript
   private updateState(updates: Partial<StateNode>, source: string): void {
     // Creates new state node
     this.currentState = this.stateFactory.updateState(this.currentState, updates);
   }
   ```

Root Cause Analysis:
1. The real StateService works correctly
2. Mock states don't properly implement the interface
3. Type casting in mocks bypasses type checks
4. Mock clone() creates more invalid mocks

Questions Raised:
1. Why are tests using mock states when the real one works?
2. Could we use the real service in tests?
3. Should we prevent type casting in mocks?

Next Actions:
1. Create proper mock class:
   ```typescript
   class MockStateService extends StateService {
     // Extend real service for proper implementation
     // Override only necessary methods
     // No type casting needed
   }
   ```

2. Add runtime type checks:
   ```typescript
   // In DirectiveService.ts:
   private ensureValidState(state: IStateService): void {
     if (typeof state.clone !== 'function') {
       throw new Error('Invalid state service: missing clone() method');
     }
   }
   ```

3. Update test factories:
   ```typescript
   export function createTestStateService(): IStateService {
     // Use real service with test configuration
     const state = new StateService();
     state.setCurrentFilePath('test.meld');
     state.enableTransformation(true);
     return state;
   }
   ```

### 32. State Factory Implementation

VERIFIED: The StateFactory manages state creation and updates:

1. **State Creation**:
```typescript
createState(options?: StateNodeOptions): StateNode {
  const state: StateNode = {
    variables: {
      text: new Map(options?.parentState?.variables.text ?? []),
      data: new Map(options?.parentState?.variables.data ?? []),
      path: new Map(options?.parentState?.variables.path ?? [])
    },
    commands: new Map(options?.parentState?.commands ?? []),
    imports: new Set(options?.parentState?.imports ?? []),
    nodes: [...(options?.parentState?.nodes ?? [])],
    transformedNodes: options?.parentState?.transformedNodes ? [...options.parentState.transformedNodes] : undefined,
    filePath: options?.filePath ?? options?.parentState?.filePath,
    parentState: options?.parentState
  };
  return state;
}
```

2. **State Merging**:
```typescript
mergeStates(parent: StateNode, child: StateNode): StateNode {
  // Create new maps with parent values as base
  const text = new Map(parent.variables.text);
  const data = new Map(parent.variables.data);
  const path = new Map(parent.variables.path);
  const commands = new Map(parent.commands);

  // Merge child variables - last write wins
  for (const [key, value] of child.variables.text) {
    text.set(key, value);
  }
  // ... merge other maps ...

  return {
    variables: { text, data, path },
    commands,
    imports: new Set([...parent.imports, ...child.imports]),
    nodes: [...parent.nodes, ...child.nodes],
    transformedNodes: child.transformedNodes ?? parent.transformedNodes,
    filePath: child.filePath ?? parent.filePath,
    parentState: parent.parentState
  };
}
```

3. **State Updates**:
```typescript
updateState(state: StateNode, updates: Partial<StateNode>): StateNode {
  const updated: StateNode = {
    variables: {
      text: updates.variables?.text ?? new Map(state.variables.text),
      data: updates.variables?.data ?? new Map(state.variables.data),
      path: updates.variables?.path ?? new Map(state.variables.path)
    },
    commands: updates.commands ?? new Map(state.commands),
    imports: new Set(updates.imports ?? state.imports),
    nodes: [...(updates.nodes ?? state.nodes)],
    transformedNodes: updates.transformedNodes !== undefined ? [...updates.transformedNodes] : state.transformedNodes,
    filePath: updates.filePath ?? state.filePath,
    parentState: updates.parentState ?? state.parentState
  };
  return updated;
}
```

Key Findings:
1. VERIFIED: All state operations are immutable:
   - New maps created for all collections
   - Arrays are spread into new arrays
   - No direct mutation of state

2. VERIFIED: State inheritance is preserved:
   ```typescript
   // In createState:
   parentState: options?.parentState

   // In mergeStates:
   parentState: parent.parentState

   // In updateState:
   parentState: updates.parentState ?? state.parentState
   ```

3. VERIFIED: Operation logging:
   ```typescript
   private logOperation(operation: StateOperation): void {
     this.operations.push(operation);
     logger.debug('State operation', operation);
   }
   ```

Root Cause Analysis:
1. The state factory creates valid state nodes
2. Mock states don't use the factory
3. Mock states lack proper structure
4. Mock clones don't preserve state

Questions Raised:
1. Could mocks use the real factory?
2. Should we validate state structure?
3. Are all state properties being copied?

Next Actions:
1. Create factory validator:
   ```typescript
   function validateStateNode(state: unknown): asserts state is StateNode {
     if (!state || typeof state !== 'object') {
       throw new Error('Invalid state node');
     }
     if (!('variables' in state) || !state.variables) {
       throw new Error('Missing variables in state');
     }
     // ... validate other properties ...
   }
   ```

2. Use factory in mocks:
   ```typescript
   class MockStateService extends StateService {
     private factory = new StateFactory();
     
     clone(): IStateService {
       // Use real factory for proper state structure
       const cloned = new MockStateService();
       cloned.currentState = this.factory.createState({
         source: 'mock-clone'
       });
       return cloned;
     }
   }
   ```

3. Add state structure checks:
   ```typescript
   interface StateStructure {
     readonly variables: {
       readonly text: Map<string, string>;
       readonly data: Map<string, unknown>;
       readonly path: Map<string, string>;
     };
     readonly commands: Map<string, CommandDefinition>;
     readonly imports: Set<string>;
     readonly nodes: ReadonlyArray<MeldNode>;
     readonly transformedNodes?: ReadonlyArray<MeldNode>;
     readonly filePath?: string;
     readonly parentState?: StateNode;
   }
   ```

// ... existing code ...
