# Meld API-First Development Plan

## Overview

This document outlines our plan to complete the Meld implementation using an API-first approach. We will:

1. Focus solely on completing and strengthening the API
2. Build a new CLI as a thin wrapper on top of the completed API

This approach will result in a cleaner architecture with less duplication, and the CLI will benefit from the well-tested API underneath.

## Progress Update

As of our latest milestone, we have:

1. Completed Phase 2.1 (API Surface Refinement)
2. Identified issues with API integration tests that need to be addressed
3. Created a detailed plan for fixing these tests before proceeding with CLI implementation

## Existing Infrastructure Assessment

After careful review, we have identified that we already have substantial infrastructure in place:

### Path Handling
- `PathService` with test mode support (`enableTestMode()`)
- Path validation and resolution for special variables ($HOMEPATH/$~, $PROJECTPATH/$.)
- Path validation and resolution for user-defined path variables ($path) created by @path directives
- `TestContext.resolveSpecialPath()` for handling special path syntax in tests
- Existing path tests in `PathService.test.ts` and `PathService.tmp.test.ts`

### Testing Infrastructure
- Comprehensive `TestContext` with methods for:
  - File operations (`writeFile`, etc.)
  - Path resolution (`resolveSpecialPath`)
  - CLI testing (`setupCliTest`)
  - Environment variable management (`withEnvironment`)
  - Service management (`enableTransformation`, `disableTransformation`, etc.)
- `MemfsTestFileSystem` for in-memory file operations
- `MemfsTestFileSystemAdapter` for CLI testing
- CLI-specific test helpers:
  - `cliTestHelper.ts` with `setupCliTest`
  - `mockProcessExit.ts` and `mockConsole.ts`
- Debug services:
  - `StateDebuggerService`
  - `StateTrackingService`
  - `StateVisualizationService`
  - `StateHistoryService`

### Service Management
- Service validation via `validateServicePipeline()`
- Service initialization order management
- Error handling for service initialization via `ServiceInitializationError`
- Pipeline validation tests in `pipelineValidation.test.ts`

## Phase 1: API Completion and Enhancement (3-5 days)
