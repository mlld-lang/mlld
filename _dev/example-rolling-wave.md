# Rolling Wave Plan Example

## About This Format
This is a rolling wave plan. Current / next work is thoroughly detailed and implementation-focused, future work has slight detail, distant work is just a simple outline of deliverables. As phases complete, the plan "rolls forward" with upcoming phases becoming more detailed. A phase is work that can be done in a day. Each phase is split into a few 2-hour sessions. Each phase should have exit criteria which include updating the next phase's plan and other relevant docs.
