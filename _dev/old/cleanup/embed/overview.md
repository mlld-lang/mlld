# Architectural Assessment: Type System Redesign for Meld Pipeline

## Core Problems

Our detailed review reveals fundamental architectural issues stemming from our type system design:

1. **Runtime Type Detection Instead of Static Types**
   - Services perform runtime inspection of node properties to determine behavior
   - Example: `if (typeof directive.path === 'object' && directive.path.isVariableReference)` appears throughout the codebase
   - This creates a semantic gap between the AST structure and the processing logic

2. **Context Objects as Unstructured Metadata Carriers**
   - Ad-hoc properties added to context objects (`isInVariableContext`, `isInEmbedDirective`)
   - Multiple flags serving similar purposes (`disablePathPrefixing`, `preventPathPrefixing`)
   - No validation that required context fields are present

3. **Responsibility Confusion Between Services**
   - Both OutputService and EmbedDirectiveHandler perform variable resolution
   - State management functionality spread across multiple services
   - Transformation logic duplicated in multiple places

4. **Inconsistent Design Pattern Application**
   - Factory patterns used in some areas but bypassed in others
   - DI principles applied inconsistently, leading to tight coupling
   - Error handling strategies vary widely across the codebase

## Proposed Solution: Layered Type System

The proposed layered type system addresses these issues through:

1. **Core Layer**: Essential data required by all services
   - Explicit subtype discrimination (`subtype: 'embedPath' | 'embedVariable' | 'embedTemplate'`)
   - Complete location and identity information
   - Source preservation for errors and debugging

2. **Service-Specific Layer**: Focused metadata per service
   - Each service defines its own metadata interface
   - Service functionality isolated to service implementation
   - Clear separation of concerns between services

3. **Debug Layer**: Optional development-only information
   - Performance monitoring, visualization, state tracking
   - Conditionally included based on environment
   - No production overhead

## Architectural Benefits

This approach delivers several key benefits:

1. **Elimination of Runtime Type Detection**
   - Services can rely on static types rather than inspecting properties
   - TypeScript's discriminated unions provide safety and clarity
   - Pattern matching replaces complex conditionals

2. **Clear Service Boundaries**
   - Each service is responsible for its own metadata
   - Service implementations focus on behavior, not type detection
   - Interfaces reflect actual dependencies between services

3. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Core types provide essential functionality
   - Services add their own metadata as needed
   - Debug layer only active during development

4. **Consistent Design Patterns**
   - Factory pattern for all context creation
   - DI principles consistently applied
   - Standard error handling throughout pipeline

## Antipatterns to Watch For

Several antipatterns appeared in the service feedback that should be avoided:

1. **Type Overloading**: Some services (particularly state services) requested extensive metadata be included in core types, which would create bloated types used by all services
   
2. **Implementation Details in Types**: Services requested types that expose their implementation details rather than focusing on interface boundaries

3. **Circular Dependencies**: Some services requested metadata that would create circular dependencies in the type system

4. **Inconsistent Responsibility Models**: Different services had conflicting views of where functionality should live (in types vs. in services)

## Implementation Strategy

1. Start with the core types for `@embed` and `@run` directives
2. Enhance the ParserService to transform AST nodes into strongly typed versions
3. Update one directive handler at a time to use the new types
4. Remove runtime type detection in favor of discriminated unions
5. Formalize service-specific metadata interfaces
6. Add debug layer with conditional compilation

## Balancing Tradeoffs

When implementing this approach, balance these key tradeoffs:

1. **Type Completeness vs. Simplicity**
   - Core layer should remain minimal but complete
   - Service metadata should be isolated to services that need it
   - Debug information should be entirely separate

2. **Backward Compatibility vs. Clean Architecture**
   - Initially support both approaches with the transformation in ParserService
   - Gradually migrate handlers to use strict types
   - Eventually remove the compatibility layer

3. **Performance vs. Type Safety**
   - Type checking happens at compile time with no runtime overhead
   - Service boundaries enable better performance optimization
   - Debug layer can be disabled in production for better performance

This approach aligns with the core principles of DI while providing a clear path forward for addressing the architectural issues in the Meld pipeline.
