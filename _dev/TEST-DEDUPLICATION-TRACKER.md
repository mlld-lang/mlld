# Test Deduplication Audit Tracker

## Purpose
Track the comprehensive audit of all service tests to identify duplicates between `.test.ts` and `.fixture.test.ts` files, and determine which tests need fixture migration.

## Audit Process
For each service/handler:
1. Read `.fixture.test.ts` file to understand coverage
2. Review each test in `.test.ts` file
3. Categorize each test as:
   - **Duplicate** - Functionality already covered by fixture tests (remove)
   - **Unique/Keep** - Tests service-specific behavior not covered by fixtures
   - **Needs Migration** - Unique test that should use fixtures

## Audit Status Overview

## Detailed Findings

### TextDirectiveHandler
**Date Audited**: 5/19/2025
**Fixture Test File**: `TextDirectiveHandler.fixture.test.ts`
**Manual Test File**: `TextDirectiveHandler.test.ts`

#### Fixture Test Coverage
- âœ… Simple text assignments with string literals (text-assignment fixtures)
- âœ… Template literals with variable interpolation (text-template fixtures)
- âœ… Multiline templates (text-template-multiline fixtures)
- âœ… Error handling for undefined variables
- âœ… Comprehensive coverage via getFixturesByKind/getFixturesByKindAndSubtype methods

#### Manual Test Analysis
| Test Name | Category | Action | Notes |
|-----------|----------|---------|--------|
| should handle a simple text assignment with string literal | Duplicate | Remove | Covered by text-assignment fixtures |
| should handle text assignment with escaped characters | Unique | Keep | Tests specific escape sequences (\n, \t, \") not in fixtures |
| should handle a template literal in text directive | Needs Migration | Migrate | Could use text-template fixtures |
| should handle object property interpolation in text value | Needs Migration | Migrate | Tests field access, could use fixtures with object vars |
| should handle path referencing in text values | Unique | Keep | Tests specific path variable resolution logic |
| should throw DirectiveError if text interpolation contains undefined variables | Unique | Keep | Tests error propagation and mock behavior |
| should handle basic variable interpolation | Duplicate | Remove | Covered by text-template fixtures |

#### Summary
- Tests to remove: 2
  - "should handle a simple text assignment with string literal"
  - "should handle basic variable interpolation"
- Tests to keep as-is: 3
  - "should handle text assignment with escaped characters"
  - "should handle path referencing in text values"
  - "should throw DirectiveError if text interpolation contains undefined variables"
- Tests to migrate to fixtures: 2
  - "should handle a template literal in text directive"
  - "should handle object property interpolation in text value"

## Migration Priority

Based on the audit findings, prioritize migration in this order:
1. [To be determined after audit]
2. [To be determined after audit]
3. [To be determined after audit]

## Success Metrics

### Before Audit
- Total test files: [Count]
- Total test cases: [Count]
- Duplicate test coverage: [Unknown]

### After Audit (Target)
- Test files consolidated: [Target count]
- Test cases after deduplication: [Target count]
- Tests using fixtures: [Target %]

## Implementation Guidelines

### When to Keep Manual Tests
- Tests that mock specific error conditions
- Tests that verify service-specific behavior
- Tests that check edge cases not covered by fixtures
- Unit tests for internal helper methods

### When to Use Fixtures
- Tests that validate AST node processing
- Tests that check directive handling
- Integration tests
- Tests that need real AST structures

### Migration Process
1. Identify appropriate fixture from `core/ast/fixtures/`
2. Replace manual node construction with fixture loading
3. Update assertions to match fixture structure
4. Verify test still validates intended behavior
5. Remove any resulting duplicate tests

## Notes
- Fixture tests should cover general AST processing behavior
- Manual tests should focus on service-specific edge cases
- Keep service dependency mocking separate from AST fixtures
- Document why specific tests are kept as manual tests
