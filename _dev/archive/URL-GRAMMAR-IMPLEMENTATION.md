# URL Grammar Implementation Summary

## What We Built

We've successfully implemented unified path handling at the grammar level that allows the AST to distinguish between local filesystem paths and URLs.

### 1. Created Unified PathExpression Rule

**File**: `grammar/patterns/path-expression.peggy`

This new pattern file provides a single entry point (`PathExpression`) that intelligently routes to:
- `URLSectionPath` - URLs with section markers (e.g., `https://example.com/file.md#section`)
- `URLPath` - Standard URLs (e.g., `https://example.com/file.md`)
- `FileSectionPath` - Local paths with sections (e.g., `./file.md#section`)
- `FilePath` - Standard local paths (e.g., `./file.md`)

### 2. Updated All Directives

Updated the following directives to use `PathExpression` instead of `PathCore`:
- **@import** (`grammar/directives/import.peggy`)
- **@path** (`grammar/directives/path.peggy`) 
- **@add** (`grammar/directives/add.peggy`)
- **@text** (`grammar/directives/text.peggy`)
- **RHS patterns** (`grammar/patterns/rhs.peggy`)
- **Section extraction** (`grammar/core/section.peggy`)

### 3. AST Structure

The AST now produces path nodes with clear subtype discrimination:

```javascript
{
  type: 'path',
  subtype: 'urlPath' | 'filePath' | 'urlSectionPath' | 'fileSectionPath',
  values: {
    // For URLs: url, protocol, parts
    // For files: path
  },
  raw: { ... },
  meta: {
    isUrl: boolean,
    protocol: string (for URLs),
    hasVariables: boolean,
    pathSubtype: string // Preserved in directives
  }
}
```

## Current Status

### ✅ Working
- **Unquoted URLs**: `@path api = https://api.example.com/v1` correctly produces `subtype: 'urlPath'`
- **Variable interpolation**: URLs support `@var` references like `https://@domain/api`
- **All existing tests pass**: No regressions introduced
- **Grammar builds successfully**: All files integrate properly

### ⚠️ Known Limitations
- **Quoted URLs**: Currently, quoted URLs like `"https://example.com"` are parsed as file paths due to how `WrappedPathContent` works
- **Brackets required**: Some directives expect specific delimiters (quotes vs brackets)

## Test Results

```bash
# Unquoted URL - Works perfectly
@path api = https://api.example.com/v1
# Result: subtype: 'urlPath', protocol: 'https'

# Bracketed URL - Parsed through special path handling
@path api = [https://api.example.com/v1]
# Result: Recognized as path but through bracket handler

# Quoted URL - Currently parsed as file path
@import {*} from "https://example.com/config.mld"
# Result: subtype: 'filePath' (needs fixing)
```

## Next Steps for Full Integration

1. **Fix Quoted URL Parsing**: Need to adjust how quotes interact with URL detection
2. **Interpreter Implementation**: The interpreter team can now use `path.subtype` to branch between URL fetching and file reading
3. **Add URL-specific Tests**: Create comprehensive test cases for all URL patterns
4. **Documentation**: Update syntax documentation to show URL support

## Key Files Modified

1. `grammar/patterns/path-expression.peggy` (new)
2. `grammar/directives/import.peggy`
3. `grammar/directives/path.peggy`
4. `grammar/directives/add.peggy`
5. `grammar/directives/text.peggy`
6. `grammar/patterns/rhs.peggy`
7. `grammar/core/section.peggy`

The grammar foundation is in place. The interpreter can now detect URLs via the `subtype` field and handle them appropriately.
