# Security & Registry Implementation Status

## Completed Work

### Security Infrastructure ✅
1. **Security Module Structure**
   - ✅ Created `security/` directory with all planned subdirectories
   - ✅ Implemented `SecurityManager.ts` as central coordinator
   - ✅ Moved existing security modules (`ImportApproval`, `ImmutableCache`, `GistTransformer`)
   - ✅ Created all security subsystem modules:
     - `command/` - CommandAnalyzer and CommandExecutor
     - `path/` - PathValidator
     - `import/` - Import security (existing + enhanced)
     - `cache/` - ImmutableCache
     - `registry/` - Registry integration
     - `taint/` - TaintTracker
     - `url/` - URLValidator
     - `policy/` - Policy patterns

2. **Command Security**
   - ✅ CommandAnalyzer with dangerous pattern detection
   - ✅ CommandExecutor extracted from Environment
   - ✅ Integration with taint tracking

3. **Path Security**
   - ✅ PathValidator with sensitive path protection
   - ✅ Path traversal prevention
   - ✅ Read/write permission checking

4. **Taint Tracking**
   - ✅ TaintTracker implementation
   - ✅ Multiple taint levels including registry-specific ones
   - ✅ Integration with import system

5. **Registry Integration in Security**
   - ✅ RegistryResolver in security module
   - ✅ AdvisoryChecker for security warnings
   - ✅ Integration with existing ImportApproval

### Registry Infrastructure ✅
1. **Core Registry Components**
   - ✅ Created `core/registry/` module
   - ✅ Implemented all core components:
     - `RegistryManager` - Main entry point
     - `RegistryResolver` - Resolves mlld:// URLs
     - `LockFile` - Lock file management
     - `Cache` - Local caching
     - `StatsCollector` - Usage statistics

2. **Registry Features**
   - ✅ Lock file support for reproducible imports
   - ✅ Local caching for offline support
   - ✅ Stats collection (local)
   - ✅ Advisory checking integration
   - ✅ CLI commands structure in RegistryManager

3. **Registry Files**
   - ✅ Created `registry/` directory with:
     - `registry.json` - Module mappings
     - `advisories.json` - Security advisories

## Pending/In Progress Work

### Security Gaps
1. **Policy Management**
   - ❌ PolicyManager not implemented (commented out in SecurityManager)
   - ❌ Immutable security policy file (~/.mlld/security-policy.json)
   - ❌ Policy evaluation logic

2. **Audit System**
   - ❌ AuditLogger not implemented (commented out)
   - ❌ Audit log storage and format
   - ❌ Audit trail for security decisions

3. **Security Hooks**
   - ❌ Hook system partially implemented but not integrated
   - ❌ Pre-execution hooks in interpreter
   - ❌ Post-execution security checks

4. **Integration Points**
   - ❌ Environment.ts not updated to use SecurityManager
   - ❌ Interpreter hooks not implemented
   - ❌ Pre-flight security checks

### Registry Gaps
1. **CLI Integration**
   - ❌ Registry CLI commands not connected to CLI entry point
   - ❌ `mlld registry` subcommands not implemented
   - ❌ Auth flow for future publishing

2. **Import Resolution**
   - ❌ Interpreter not updated to use RegistryManager
   - ❌ Import evaluator doesn't resolve mlld:// URLs

3. **Documentation**
   - ❌ User documentation for registry usage
   - ❌ Security best practices guide

## Documents Status

### Archive These (Completed/Superseded)
1. **SECURITY-MIGRATION-PLAN.md** - ✅ Migration completed
2. **SECURITY-MVP-WITH-REGISTRY.md** - ✅ MVP implemented

### Keep for Reference
1. **SECURITY.md** - Core security design (still relevant)
2. **SECURITY-REGISTRY-INTEGRATION.md** - Integration details (still relevant)
3. **REGISTRY-PHASE1-DNS.md** - Current implementation guide
4. **REGISTRY-PHASE2-SERVICE.md** - Future web service plans

## Next Steps Priority

### 1. Complete Security Integration (2-3 days)
- [ ] Implement PolicyManager with immutable policies
- [ ] Add AuditLogger for security decisions
- [ ] Update Environment.ts to use SecurityManager
- [ ] Add interpreter hooks for pre-execution checks
- [ ] Implement pre-flight security analysis

### 2. Complete Registry Integration (1-2 days)
- [ ] Connect registry commands to CLI
- [ ] Update import evaluator to use RegistryManager
- [ ] Add registry resolution to interpreter
- [ ] Test end-to-end import flow

### 3. Testing & Documentation (2 days)
- [ ] Integration tests for security + registry
- [ ] Attack scenario testing
- [ ] User documentation
- [ ] Migration guide for existing users

### 4. Polish & Release (1 day)
- [ ] Error messages and UX improvements
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Release notes
- [ ] Announcement preparation

## Configuration Status

### What Works Now
```json
{
  "security": {
    "imports": {
      "requireApproval": true,
      "pinByDefault": true
    }
  }
}
```

### What Needs Implementation
```json
{
  "security": {
    "mode": "interactive",
    "commands": {
      "preFlightCheck": true,
      "blockLLMExecution": true
    },
    "registry": {
      "enabled": true,
      "advisoryCheck": true,
      "cacheTime": 3600000
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing Status

### What's Tested
- ✅ Individual security components (unit tests)
- ✅ Import approval flow
- ✅ Basic command analysis

### What Needs Testing
- ❌ End-to-end security flow
- ❌ Registry import resolution
- ❌ Attack scenarios
- ❌ Performance impact

## Summary

The security and registry infrastructure is **80% complete**. The core components are built and in place, but the integration points and policy enforcement are missing. The next priority should be:

1. **Hook up what's built** - Connect SecurityManager to Environment/Interpreter
2. **Implement missing pieces** - PolicyManager and AuditLogger
3. **Test the full flow** - Ensure security actually blocks malicious operations
4. **Document for users** - How to use the registry and understand security

The architecture is solid and well-organized. The main work remaining is "last mile" integration and testing.
