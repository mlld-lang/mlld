# Error Test Example

This file demonstrates error handling in Meld.

```meld:define
name = "Error Test"
```

{$name} should be replaced with "Error Test".

This will cause an error because `undefinedVariable` is not defined:

{$undefinedVariable}

The rest of the file should still be processed correctly.

{$name} should still be visible.
