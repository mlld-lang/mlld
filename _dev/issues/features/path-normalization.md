# Path Normalization: Improving Consistency and Reliability

## Summary

Meld's current path handling system works but contains implementation inconsistencies that create technical debt and maintenance challenges. This document outlines the value of path normalization as a future enhancement.

## The Problem

### Current Implementation Challenges

1. **Multiple Path Normalization Patterns**
   - Different services implement their own path normalization logic
   - No single source of truth for "correct" path format
   - Some paths use backslashes, others forward slashes
   - Inconsistent handling of leading and trailing slashes

2. **Brittle Test Suite**
   - TestSnapshot uses complex path detection heuristics
   - Different test suites expect different path formats
   - Path-specific test cases contain hard-coded bypasses
   - Small changes to paths can break unrelated tests

3. **Platform Inconsistency**
   - Windows vs. Unix path differences cause intermittent issues
   - Cross-platform testing requires special handling

### Impact on Development

These issues cause:
- **Increased Maintenance Burden**: Developers need to understand multiple path handling systems
- **Test Flakiness**: Tests occasionally fail due to path formatting differences
- **Difficulty Implementing New Features**: Path-related features require careful navigation of existing patterns
- **Onboarding Complexity**: New developers struggle to understand path handling nuances

## Why Address This

### Value Proposition

1. **Developer Productivity**
   - Reduce time spent debugging path-related issues
   - Eliminate special-case handling in tests
   - Make path-related changes more predictable

2. **Test Reliability**
   - Remove brittle path detection logic
   - Create consistent expectations across test suites
   - Reduce test failures caused by path formatting

3. **Code Simplification**
   - Remove duplicate path handling code
   - Eliminate complex conditional logic in TestSnapshot
   - Simplify path comparison operations

4. **Foundation for Future Improvements**
   - Enable more consistent error messages for path issues
   - Support better cross-platform behavior
   - Allow for more advanced path handling features

## Proposed Approach

### Goals

- Create a standardized path format throughout the codebase
- Provide utilities that make path handling consistent
- Preserve existing functionality while improving implementation
- Implement changes incrementally to minimize disruption

### Non-Goals

- Changing user-facing path behavior
- Modifying path resolution rules or variable handling
- Rearchitecting the entire path system

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Research and Documentation**
   - Document current path handling mechanisms
   - Identify all special cases and requirements
   - Create inventory of path-related tests

2. **Central Utilities**
   - Create standardized `normalizeMeldPath` function
   - Implement with consistent rules:
     - Forward slashes only
     - Consistent leading slash handling
     - Consistent trailing slash handling
   - Add thorough unit tests with platform-specific cases

3. **Incremental Integration**
   - Start with TestSnapshot to remove brittle detection logic
   - Update path comparison logic
   - Gradually expand to other services
   - Verify tests pass after each step

## Relationship to Other Work

This task is **independent** of the TSyringe DI migration and should be scheduled separately. While originally considered as part of the DI cleanup, these concerns are orthogonal and should be addressed on their own timeline.

## Future Considerations

Long-term improvements enabled by path normalization:
- Better error messages for path resolution failures
- More consistent handling of path variables
- Improved cross-platform behavior
- Simplified path transformation operations

## Next Steps

1. Schedule this work for after completion of the TSyringe DI migration
2. Begin by documenting current path handling approaches
3. Create comprehensive testing strategy for path normalization
4. Implement an incremental rollout plan
