# Path Normalization: Improving Consistency and Reliability

## Summary

Meld's current path handling system works but contains implementation inconsistencies that create technical debt and maintenance challenges. This document outlines the value of path normalization as a future enhancement.

## The Problem

### Current Implementation Challenges

1. **Multiple Path Normalization Patterns**
   - Different services implement their own path normalization logic
   - No single source of truth for "correct" path format
   - Some paths use backslashes, others forward slashes
   - Inconsistent handling of leading and trailing slashes

2. **Brittle Test Suite**
   - TestSnapshot uses complex path detection heuristics
   - Different test suites expect different path formats
   - Path-specific test cases contain hard-coded bypasses
   - Small changes to paths can break unrelated tests

3. **Platform Inconsistency**
   - Windows vs. Unix path differences cause intermittent issues
   - Cross-platform testing requires special handling

### Impact on Development

These issues cause:
- **Increased Maintenance Burden**: Developers need to understand multiple path handling systems
- **Test Flakiness**: Tests occasionally fail due to path formatting differences
- **Difficulty Implementing New Features**: Path-related features require careful navigation of existing patterns
- **Onboarding Complexity**: New developers struggle to understand path handling nuances

## Why Address This

### Value Proposition

1. **Developer Productivity**
   - Reduce time spent debugging path-related issues
   - Eliminate special-case handling in tests
   - Make path-related changes more predictable

2. **Test Reliability**
   - Remove brittle path detection logic
   - Create consistent expectations across test suites
   - Reduce test failures caused by path formatting

3. **Code Simplification**
   - Remove duplicate path handling code
   - Eliminate complex conditional logic in TestSnapshot
   - Simplify path comparison operations

4. **Foundation for Future Improvements**
   - Enable more consistent error messages for path issues
   - Support better cross-platform behavior
   - Allow for more advanced path handling features

## Proposed Approach

### Goals

- Create a standardized path format throughout the codebase
- Provide utilities that make path handling consistent
- Preserve existing functionality while improving implementation
- Implement changes incrementally to minimize disruption

### Non-Goals

- Changing user-facing path behavior
- Modifying path resolution rules or variable handling
- Rearchitecting the entire path system

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Research and Documentation**
   - Document current path handling mechanisms
   - Identify all special cases and requirements
   - Create inventory of path-related tests

2. **Central Utilities**
   - Create standardized `normalizeMeldPath` function
   - Implement with consistent rules:
     - Forward slashes only
     - Consistent leading slash handling
     - Consistent trailing slash handling
   - Add thorough unit tests with platform-specific cases

3. **Incremental Integration**
   - Start with TestSnapshot to remove brittle detection logic
   - Update path comparison logic
   - Gradually expand to other services
   - Verify tests pass after each step

## Relationship to Other Work

This task is **independent** of the TSyringe DI migration and should be scheduled separately. While originally considered as part of the DI cleanup, these concerns are orthogonal and should be addressed on their own timeline.

## Future Considerations

Long-term improvements enabled by path normalization:
- Better error messages for path resolution failures
- More consistent handling of path variables
- Improved cross-platform behavior
- Simplified path transformation operations

## Next Steps

1. Schedule this work for after completion of the TSyringe DI migration
2. Begin by documenting current path handling approaches
3. Create comprehensive testing strategy for path normalization
4. Implement an incremental rollout plan

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create the Core Utility

Create a standardized path normalization utility in PathOperationsService:

```typescript
/**
 * Normalize a file path to the standard format used throughout the codebase.
 * This ensures consistent handling of paths across different platforms and contexts.
 * 
 * Standard format:
 * - Always use forward slashes, never backslashes
 * - Paths are always absolute (start with '/')
 * - No trailing slashes except for root ('/')
 */
export function normalizeMeldPath(path: string): string {
  if (!path) return '/';
  
  // Replace backslashes with forward slashes
  let normalized = path.replace(/\\/g, '/');
  
  // Ensure path starts with a slash
  if (!normalized.startsWith('/')) {
    normalized = '/' + normalized;
  }
  
  // Remove trailing slash unless it's the root path
  if (normalized.length > 1 && normalized.endsWith('/')) {
    normalized = normalized.slice(0, -1);
  }
  
  return normalized;
}
```

Add this as both a method on PathOperationsService and as a standalone function for flexibility.

### 2. Update TestSnapshot First

Update the TestSnapshot class to use the new utility without changing behavior:

```typescript
private normalizePaths(snapshot: Map<string, string>): Map<string, string> {
  const normalized = new Map<string, string>();
  
  for (const [path, content] of snapshot.entries()) {
    // Use new utility but maintain backward compatible behavior
    let normalizedPath = normalizeMeldPath(path);
    
    // Apply any test-specific adaptations needed for compatibility
    if (this.isTestContextTest) {
      normalizedPath = this.adaptPathForTestContext(normalizedPath);
    }
    
    normalized.set(normalizedPath, content);
  }
  
  return normalized;
}
```

This provides the utility while keeping compatibility with existing tests.

### 3. Document the Approach

Add documentation for path normalization in the codebase:
- Add to docs/dev/DI.md
- Add comments in key locations where path normalization is used
- Document the standard format and rationale

### 4. Verify with Tests

Create specific tests for the path normalization utility:
- Test various input formats
- Verify it handles edge cases correctly
- Ensure it's consistent across platforms

### 5. Gradual Integration

Once the utility and TestSnapshot changes are in place and tested:
- Identify other key places where path normalization occurs
- Begin carefully replacing custom normalization with the standard utility
- Test thoroughly after each change

## Testing Strategy

For this task:
1. Create a separate branch
2. Implement the utility and core TestSnapshot changes
3. Run the full test suite to ensure nothing breaks
4. If all tests pass, proceed with additional integration
5. If tests fail, isolate issues and fix them before proceeding

## Expected Outcomes

After completing this task:
- Path normalization will be more consistent and reliable
- TestSnapshot will use the standardized approach
- The codebase will be better prepared for further DI cleanup
- No existing tests will be broken
