# Implement TSyringe DI Refactoring - Phase 9: Final Review and Integration

This document outlines the final phases of the TSyringe dependency injection (DI) refactoring, focusing on review, integration testing, and preparation for merge to main.

## Completed Phase 8: Service Mock Updates
- Added `@injectable()` decorator to mock services
- Created DI-compatible versions of all mock services
- Added TestContainerHelper utilities
- Enhanced TestContextDI with additional capabilities
- Fixed failing tests related to path normalization in test snapshots
- Ensured all tests pass with both DI enabled and disabled

## Phase 9: Code Review and Integration

### Code Review Tasks
- [ ] Review all modified code in the tsyringe branch
- [ ] Identify expedient but non-ideal fixes (e.g., hardcoded values, special cases)
- [ ] Find areas where we took shortcuts to make tests pass but should implement proper solutions
- [ ] Document these issues in _dev/issues/features/tsyringe-cleanup.md (created)
- [ ] Classify issues as "must fix before merge" vs "can fix later"

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Run comprehensive integration tests across the entire codebase
- [ ] Test with real filesystem operations
- [ ] Test with CLI commands
- [ ] Test with various meld file formats
- [ ] Verify all error handling still works correctly
- [ ] Ensure no regressions in functionality

### Performance Verification
- [ ] Compare performance metrics before and after DI implementation
- [ ] Identify any performance bottlenecks introduced by DI
- [ ] Optimize critical paths if necessary

## Phase 10: Documentation and Clean-up

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update architecture documentation to reflect DI approach
- [ ] Document how to create new services with TSyringe
- [ ] Add examples of common DI patterns
- [ ] Document testing patterns for services with dependencies

### Code Clean-up
- [ ] Address critical issues from the code review
- [ ] Remove any temporary compatibility code
- [ ] Ensure consistent DI pattern usage across codebase
- [ ] Clean up test container setup code for consistency
- [ ] Remove redundant initialize() calls
- [ ] Prepare for feature flag removal in future

## Phase 11: Branch Merge and Release

### Pre-Merge Tasks
- [ ] Final full test suite run
- [ ] Code review by team members
- [ ] Update change log with DI migration details

### Merge and Release
- [ ] Merge tsyringe branch into main
- [ ] Create a new release version
- [ ] Tag release in git
- [ ] Update package.json version

### Post-Release
- [ ] Verify the released version works correctly
- [ ] Monitor for any issues related to the DI migration
- [ ] Plan follow-up tasks for remaining issues in tsyringe-cleanup.md
