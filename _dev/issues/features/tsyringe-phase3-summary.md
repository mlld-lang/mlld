# TSyringe Dependency Injection Migration - Phase 3 Summary

## Overview

Phase 3 of the TSyringe dependency injection migration focused on decorating foundational service classes with the `@Service()` decorator and updating their tests to work with both DI and non-DI modes. This builds on the groundwork laid in Phases 1 and 2.

## Services Decorated

The following services were decorated with the `@Service()` decorator:

1. **PathOperationsService**: A simple utility service with no dependencies
2. **PathService**: A service with minimal dependencies (uses FileSystemService)
3. **CircularityService**: A service for detecting circular imports

## Test Updates

The tests for each decorated service were updated to:

1. Use the `TestContextDI` helper from Phase 2
2. Support both DI and non-DI modes through parameterized tests
3. Obtain service instances through either `context.container.resolve()` or `createService()`
4. Clean up properly after each test with `context.cleanup()`

### Test Template

We established a pattern for testing services with DI support:

```typescript
describe('ServiceName', () => {
  // Define tests for both DI and non-DI modes
  describe.each([
    { useDI: true, name: 'with DI' },
    { useDI: false, name: 'without DI' },
  ])('$name', ({ useDI }) => {
    let context: TestContextDI;
    let service: IServiceName;

    beforeEach(() => {
      // Create test context with appropriate DI setting
      context = useDI 
        ? TestContextDI.withDI() 
        : TestContextDI.withoutDI();

      // Get service instance using the appropriate mode
      service = useDI
        ? context.container.resolve<IServiceName>('IServiceName')
        : createService(ServiceName);
    });

    afterEach(async () => {
      await context.cleanup();
    });

    // Tests go here...
  });
});
```

## Benefits and Progress

1. **Gradual Migration**: We're incrementally adding DI support while maintaining backward compatibility
2. **Consistent Pattern**: Established a pattern for decorating services and updating tests
3. **Testing in Both Modes**: All tests now verify functionality in both DI and non-DI modes
4. **Foundational Services**: Started with simple services that have minimal dependencies

## Next Steps (Phase 4)

1. **Extend to More Services**: Continue adding `@Service()` decorator to more complex services
2. **Dependency Tracking**: Add more detailed dependency metadata to `@Service()` decorators
3. **Constructor Injection**: Begin transitioning services to use constructor injection rather than `initialize()` methods
4. **Target Complex Services**: Focus on services with more complex dependency relationships

## Challenges and Considerations

1. **Test Indentation**: Need to be careful with test indentation due to the nested describe blocks
2. **Circular Dependencies**: Will need special handling for services with circular dependencies
3. **Test Isolation**: Must ensure proper cleanup between tests to prevent state leakage
4. **Registration Timing**: Services need to be registered before they're resolved in DI mode
