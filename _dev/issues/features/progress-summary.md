# TSyringe Dependency Injection Cleanup Progress

## Work Completed

We've made significant progress on the first phases of the TSyringe DI cleanup plan:

### Phase 1: Removing Dual-Mode Pattern

- **ServiceProvider Changes**:
  - Modified `shouldUseDI()` to always return true (DI is now mandatory)
  - Updated all service registration and resolution functions to always use DI
  - Removed legacy code paths from the Service decorator
  - Simplified function signatures to be more type-safe and focused

- **StateService Updates**:
  - Simplified the constructor to remove dual-mode branching
  - Streamlined the `initialize()` method 
  - Removed conditional logic in key methods like `createChildState()` and `clone()`

- **TestContext Updates**:
  - Updated TestContextDI to always use DI mode
  - Simplified methods that had conditional DI/non-DI logic
  - Added deprecation notices for legacy methods

### Phase 2: Path Normalization

- **Created Standardized Path Utilities**:
  - Added `normalizeMeldPath` function in PathOperationsService
  - Implemented consistent path format rules:
    - Always forward slashes (never backslashes)
    - Paths always start with a slash
    - No trailing slashes except for root
  - Made the utility available both as a method and standalone function

- **TestSnapshot Improvements**:
  - Refactored to use the standardized path normalization
  - Removed brittle test suite detection logic
  - Simplified the comparison algorithm

### Phase 3: Documentation

- **Created DI Documentation**:
  - Added comprehensive guide at `docs/dev/DI.md`
  - Documented best practices, patterns, and troubleshooting
  - Included code examples for common scenarios

- **Created Project Status Documentation**:
  - Created `tsyringe-cleanup-status.md` documenting current state
  - Created `tsyringe-cleanup-summary.md` with implementation details
  - Updated main `tsyringe-cleanup.md` issue tracker

## Current Status

The project is in a transitional state. We've made significant architectural improvements, but there are still some technical hurdles to overcome:

1. **Test Framework Issues**:
   - Many tests fail because they rely on the dual-mode pattern
   - The TestContext setup needs to be updated to work with DI-only mode
   - StateService constructor initialization needs refinement

2. **Migration Path**:
   - Need to complete the update of all service constructors
   - Need to implement the path normalization throughout the codebase

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Test Framework**:
   - Update TestContext and TestContextDI to properly initialize with DI
   - Make tests compatible with DI-only mode

2. **Complete Service Updates**:
   - Simplify all remaining service constructors
   - Apply path normalization consistently

3. **Additional Documentation**:
   - Document path normalization standards
   - Update architecture documentation with DI concepts

## Lessons Learned

1. The dual-mode pattern added significant complexity to the codebase
2. A more incremental approach with better test isolation would have simplified the migration
3. Standardizing path handling is crucial for cross-platform compatibility and test reliability
