# TSyringe Migration Progress

This document tracks the progress of the TSyringe dependency injection migration, focusing on which services have been fixed and which still need work.

## Overview

We're currently in **Phase 4: DI-Only Mode Transition** of the TSyringe migration. This phase involves updating services to work with the Service Mediator pattern to resolve circular dependencies.

## Migration Status Summary

| Category | Complete | Total | Percentage |
|----------|----------|-------|------------|
| Core Services | 2 | 8 | 25% |
| Test Files Passing | 2 | 97 | ~2% |
| Mediator Methods Implemented | ~4 | ~20 | ~20% |

## Services Status

### ‚úÖ Fixed Services

These services have been updated to work with the Service Mediator and their tests pass in DI-only mode:

1. **StateService**
   - Fixed proper handling of child state creation and merging
   - Updated initialization to work with DI
   - Tests now pass in DI-only mode

2. **VariableReferenceResolver**
   - Fixed variable resolution in both test and non-test contexts
   - Improved the regex-based variable resolution
   - Fixed the parser service integration for extracting references
   - Tests now pass in DI-only mode

### üîÑ In Progress Services

These services have been partially updated but their tests don't fully pass yet:

1. **FileSystemService**
   - Mediator integration started but incomplete
   - Tests fail with: "this.serviceMediator.setFileSystemService is not a function"
   - 17 failing tests need to be addressed

2. **PathService**
   - Mediator integration started but incomplete
   - Tests fail with: "this.projectPathResolver.getProjectPath is not a function"
   - Path validation needs to be fixed
   - 14 failing tests need to be addressed

3. **ResolutionService**
   - Mediator integration started but incomplete
   - Tests fail with validation issues
   - Circular reference detection not working
   - 8 failing tests need to be addressed

### ‚ùå Not Started Services

These services have not yet been updated to work with the Service Mediator:

1. **InterpreterService**
   - Needs complete update for mediator integration
   - State rollback issues
   - Circular import detection not working
   - 12 failing tests need to be addressed

2. **API/CLI Integration**
   - Missing StateService in ResolutionService
   - 17 failing tests need to be addressed

## Next Services to Fix

Based on the dependency order, we should tackle these services next:

1. **FileSystemService**
   - Foundation service that others depend on
   - Need to complete the mediator implementation for file operations

2. **PathService**
   - Foundation service that others depend on
   - Need to fix project path resolution
   - Need to complete validation rules implementation

## Success Criteria for Each Service

For a service to be considered fully migrated:

1. All its tests pass in DI-only mode
2. It properly integrates with the Service Mediator
3. It does not have any circular dependencies
4. It has proper error handling

## Test Migration Metrics

| Test Category | Passing | Total | Percentage |
|---------------|---------|-------|------------|
| State Tests | 2 | 2 | 100% |
| Resolution Tests | 1 | 6 | ~17% |
| FileSystem Tests | 0 | 3 | 0% |
| Path Tests | 0 | 2 | 0% |
| Interpreter Tests | 0 | 2 | 0% |
| Pipeline Tests | 0 | 6 | 0% |
| API/CLI Tests | 0 | 17 | 0% |

## Conclusion

We've made good progress by fixing the StateService and VariableReferenceResolver, but significant work remains to complete the TSyringe migration. By methodically working through the remaining services in dependency order, we'll continue making progress toward a fully DI-based architecture.
