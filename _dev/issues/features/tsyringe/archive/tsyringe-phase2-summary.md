# TSyringe Dependency Injection: Phase 2 Implementation

## Overview

Phase 2 of the TSyringe integration focused on enhancing the Service decorator to support inheritance and adding test infrastructure for DI. This phase builds on Phase 1's core DI architecture while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Enhanced `Service` Decorator

The `@Service()` decorator was enhanced to:
- Support metadata storage for better service documentation
- Automatically call `@injectable()` to ensure tsyringe compatibility
- Support inheritance in service hierarchies
- Include registration of both implementation and interface tokens

```typescript
export function Service(options: Partial<ServiceMetadata> = {}) {
  return function(target: any) {
    // Make the class injectable to ensure it works with tsyringe
    injectable()(target);
    
    // Extract metadata and store it on the class
    const metadata: ServiceMetadata = {
      name: target.name,
      interfaceName: target.name.charAt(0) !== 'I' ? `I${target.name}` : undefined,
      ...options
    };
    
    Reflect.defineMetadata(SERVICE_METADATA_KEY, metadata, target);
    
    // Register with container
    container.register(target, { useClass: target });
    container.register(target.name, { useClass: target });
    
    if (metadata.interfaceName) {
      container.register(metadata.interfaceName, { useClass: target });
    }
    
    return target;
  };
}
```

### 2. Test Infrastructure for DI

To support testing services with DI, we implemented:

1. **TestContainerHelper**: A helper class for managing DI in tests
   - Creates child containers for test isolation
   - Provides mock registration capabilities
   - Works with both DI-enabled and disabled modes
   - Supports resolving services with fallbacks

2. **TestContextDI**: An extension of TestContext with DI support
   - Supports both manual initialization and DI-based initialization
   - Provides consistent service access regardless of DI mode
   - Maintains API compatibility with existing tests
   - Static factory methods for creating contexts with DI enabled or disabled

### 3. Service Registration Utilities

Added new utilities for service registration:
- `registerServiceClass<T>()`: Register a service class with a token
- `registerServiceInstance<T>()`: Register a service instance with a token
- `registerServiceFactory<T>()`: Register a factory function with a token
- `getServiceMetadata()`: Get metadata for a service class

### 4. Service Metadata Support

Added support for storing and retrieving service metadata:
```typescript
export interface ServiceMetadata {
  name: string;
  interfaceName?: string;
  description?: string;
  dependencies?: Array<{ token: string | symbol; name: string }>;
}
```

This metadata helps with:
- Service documentation
- Dependency tracking
- Potential debugging/visualization tools

## Test Coverage

The implementation includes comprehensive tests:
- `ServiceProvider.test.ts`: 20 tests covering core DI functionality
- `TestContainerHelper.test.ts`: 15 tests for container helpers
- `TestContextDI.test.ts`: 8 tests for DI-aware test context

All tests pass in both DI-enabled and DI-disabled modes, ensuring backward compatibility.

## Future Steps

Phase 2 lays the groundwork for Phase 3:
- Apply the `@Service()` decorator to independent services
- Begin transitioning to constructor injection
- Use the test infrastructure for testing services with DI

## Conclusion

Phase 2 successfully implemented the planned enhancements to the Service decorator and added test infrastructure for DI. The implementation maintains full backward compatibility with both DI-enabled and DI-disabled modes, allowing for a gradual transition to DI.

The test infrastructure provides isolation and compatibility with existing tests, which will be essential for the later phases of the TSyringe migration.
