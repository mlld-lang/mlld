# TSyringe Phase 8: Service Mock Updates

This document summarizes the implementation of Phase 8 of the TSyringe migration plan, which focused on making all mock services compatible with dependency injection.

## Completed Work

1. **Added @injectable() to mock service classes**:
   - Updated InterpreterState in tests/mocks/state.ts
   - Updated directive handlers in tests/mocks/directive-handlers.ts
   - Updated MockInterpreterState in tests/mocks/setup.ts
   - Added MockDirectiveHandlerFactory class in tests/mocks/setup.ts

2. **Created DI-compatible mock services**:
   - Created MockServices.ts with injectable mock implementations:
     - MockValidationService
     - MockStateService
     - MockResolutionService
     - MockFileSystemService
     - MockCircularityService
     - MockParserService
     - MockInterpreterService
     - MockPathService
   - Added factory methods for creating these mock services
   - Added test file MockServices.test.ts to verify they work correctly

3. **Enhanced TestContextDI and TestContainerHelper**:
   - Improved TestContextDI to register mocks with the container
   - Enhanced service initialization to support mock instance creation
   - Added isolated container scopes for test independence

4. **Updated path mock utilities**:
   - Created MockPathService class in tests/mocks/path.ts
   - Added DI integration for path mocking utilities
   - Enhanced path resolution utility functions

5. **Consolidated exports**:
   - Updated tests/utils/di/index.ts to export all DI test utilities
   - Added references to MockServices
   - Made all components available through a single import

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Patterns**: All mock services now follow the same pattern with @injectable() decorators and clear interfaces
2. **Container Registration**: Mocks can be registered with the DI container using TestContainerHelper
3. **Test Isolation**: Child containers prevent state leakage between tests
4. **Backward Compatibility**: All changes maintain compatibility with non-DI code paths

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 9: Final Cleanup and Documentation**
   - Remove redundant initialize() calls
   - Add comprehensive DI documentation
   - Update architecture documentation with DI patterns
   - Prepare for potential future feature flag removal

## Testing Strategy

All changes have been tested with both USE_DI=true and USE_DI=false environment variables to ensure both code paths continue to work correctly. The implementation includes:

1. Unit tests for mock services
2. Integration tests for TestContextDI
3. Validation of container registration
4. Test container isolation verification
