## Why This Archive Exists

These documents chart the evolution of our thinking about the TSyringe migration. While they contain valuable insights, they have been superseded by the more focused and methodical approach outlined in the current documentation:

- [Main README.md](../README.md): Current entry point and progress tracker
- [Phases Directory](../phases/): Current phase-by-phase plan
- [Reference Directory](../reference/): Current reference materials

## Historical Context

The TSyringe migration began with an approach that attempted to support both DI and non-DI modes simultaneously. This created technical debt in the form of complex conditional logic. 

The current approach focuses on a more methodical, phase-by-phase migration that eventually removes dual-mode support entirely but does so in a careful way that doesn't break existing functionality.
