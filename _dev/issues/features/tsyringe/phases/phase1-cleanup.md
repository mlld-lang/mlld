# Phase 1: Foundation and Cleanup ✅

This phase focuses on creating the foundation for the TSyringe migration by cleaning up existing code without breaking functionality. These tasks can be implemented while preserving the dual-mode system.

## Objectives

1. ✅ Simplify service constructors while preserving dual-mode support
2. ✅ Improve documentation 
3. ⬜ Enhance test helpers (moved to Phase 2)

## Tasks

### 1. Constructor Simplification (Complete)

**Objective**: Refactor service constructors to be more readable while preserving dual-mode functionality.

**Implementation**:
- ✅ Refactor StateService constructor
- ✅ Refactor ResolutionService constructor
- ✅ Refactor OutputService constructor
- ✅ FileSystemService constructor (already follows pattern)
- ✅ Refactor DirectiveService constructor (handled circular dependencies)
- ✅ Remaining service constructors (already follow pattern or will be addressed in Phase 3)

**Pattern to Follow**:
```typescript
constructor(
  @inject(SomeFactory) factory?: SomeFactory,
  @inject('IDependency') dependency?: IDependency
) {
  this.initializeFromParams(factory, dependency);
}

private initializeFromParams(factory?: SomeFactory, dependency?: IDependency): void {
  if (factory) {
    // DI mode initialization
    this.initializeDIMode(factory, dependency);
  } else {
    // Legacy mode initialization
    this.initializeLegacyMode(dependency);
  }
}
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Constructors are simplified and easier to understand
- Dual-mode functionality is preserved
- Tests continue to pass
- Code is better documented

### 2. Documentation (Completed)

**Objective**: Create comprehensive documentation for the DI system.

**Implementation**:
- ✅ Document initialization patterns in service-initialization-patterns.md
- ✅ Document constructor simplification approach
- ✅ Document circular dependency handling patterns (discovered during DirectiveService refactoring)
- ⬜ Create DI best practices guide (moved to Phase 2)
- ⬜ Add examples of common DI patterns (moved to Phase 2)
- ⬜ Update architecture documentation (moved to Phase 2)

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Documentation clearly explains DI concepts
- ✅ Examples demonstrate proper usage
- ✅ Migration strategy is well-documented

### 3. Test Helper Improvement (Moved to Phase 2)

**Objective**: Enhance test utilities to better support both DI and non-DI modes.

**Implementation**:
- ⬜ Enhance TestContextDI to better handle both modes
- ⬜ Improve error messages for common test setup issues

**Success Criteria**:
- Test utilities work consistently in both modes
- Error messages are clear and helpful

**Note**: This task has been moved to Phase 2: Test Infrastructure Enhancement as it fits better there.

## Final Status ✅

- Constructor simplification has been completed for all key services:
  - StateService: Refactored to use the dual-mode pattern
  - ResolutionService: Refactored to use the dual-mode pattern
  - OutputService: Refactored to use the dual-mode pattern
  - FileSystemService: Already following the appropriate pattern
  - DirectiveService: Refactored while preserving circular dependency handling with InterpreterService
- Basic documentation has been created and meets the requirements for Phase 1
- All tests pass with the refactored constructors
- Phase 1 is now complete and we're ready to move to Phase 2

## Next Steps

1. Move to Phase 2: Test Infrastructure Enhancement
2. Implement test helper improvements (TestContextDI)
3. Document additional DI patterns discovered during Phase 1
4. Begin planning for incremental service migration in Phase 3

## Completion Date

Phase 1 completed on March 7, 2025
