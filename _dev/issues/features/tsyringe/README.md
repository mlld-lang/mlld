# TSyringe Dependency Injection Migration

> **IMPORTANT**: This document serves as the central tracking point for the TSyringe dependency injection migration project. Always update this file when working on the migration to track progress and next steps.

## Quick Start for New Developers

**Current Focus**: Implementing a Service Mediator pattern to fix circular dependencies in TSyringe DI.

**Key Files to Understand**:
1. [Strategic Plan](./reference/circular-dependency-strategic-plan.md) - Comprehensive approach to fixing circular dependencies
2. [Phase 4 Details](./phases/phase4-di-only-transition.md) - Current phase specifics
3. `/core/di-config.ts` - Main DI container configuration

**First Tasks to Work On**:
1. Create the ServiceMediator class
2. Update CircularDependency handling in core services
3. Fix test timeouts in transformation tests

## Overview

The Meld codebase is in the process of transitioning to TSyringe-based dependency injection. We're currently implementing a Service Mediator pattern to address circular dependencies between key services.

## Current Status & Priorities

### Current Focus: Service Mediator Pattern Implementation

We're implementing a Service Mediator pattern to systematically resolve circular dependencies between services like:
- FileSystemService ↔ PathService
- ParserService ↔ ResolutionService

This will address test timeouts and memory leaks we've been experiencing. See our [strategic plan](./reference/circular-dependency-strategic-plan.md) for details.

### Development Mode

The codebase currently uses a **dual-mode system** that supports both DI (via TSyringe) and non-DI modes via the `shouldUseDI()` function. We're migrating tests to "DI-only" mode in batches.

## Migration Strategy

Our migration strategy follows these key principles:

1. **Methodical Approach**: Take small, incremental steps that don't break existing functionality
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Verify tests pass after each change
3. **Dual-Mode Support**: Maintain both DI and non-DI modes until all services and tests are updated
4. **Documentation**: Document patterns and decisions for future reference

## Phase-by-Phase Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation and Cleanup (✅ Completed)
- Constructor simplification for key services
- Documentation updates
- [Details in phase1-cleanup.md](./phases/phase1-cleanup.md)

### Phase 2: Test Infrastructure Enhancement (Next Focus)
- Improve TestContextDI to better support both modes
- Create migration utilities
- Categorize tests by DI dependency
- [Details in phase2-test-preparation.md](./phases/phase2-test-preparation.md)

### Phase 3: Incremental Service Migration (✅ Completed)
- Update one service at a time to prefer DI 
- Ensure tests pass after each change
- Track progress service by service
- [Details in phase3-service-migration.md](./phases/phase3-service-migration.md)

### Phase 4: DI-Only Mode Transition
- Add opt-in flag for DI-only mode in tests
- Update tests in batches to use DI-only mode
- Document migration progress
- [Details in phase4-di-only-transition.md](./phases/phase4-di-only-transition.md)

### Phase 5: Final Cleanup

### Remaining Issues

We still have 64 failing tests that need to be addressed. These have been categorized and documented in [tracking/remaining-failures.md](./tracking/remaining-failures.md) with specific fix strategies:

1. API/CLI Integration Tests (17 failures) - "StateService is required for ResolutionService"
2. FileSystemService Tests (17 failures) - "this.serviceMediator.setFileSystemService is not a function"
3. PathService Tests (14 failures) - "this.projectPathResolver.getProjectPath is not a function"
4. InterpreterService Tests (12 failures) - State rollback and circular import detection failures
5. ResolutionService Tests (8 failures) - Validation failures for variables and references

### Next Steps (Prioritized)

#### Immediate Actions (Next 1-2 Days)
1. Complete the Service Mediator implementation for FileSystemService and PathService
2. Fix the FileSystemService tests
3. Fix the PathService tests
4. Update the remaining-failures.md document as progress is made

## Implementation Guidelines

When working on this migration:

1. **Update this file first** - Record your progress and next steps
2. **Take small steps** - Make incremental changes that don't break tests
3. **Test thoroughly** - Run tests after each significant change
4. **Document patterns** - Note recurring patterns for future reference
5. **Preserve behavior** - Don't change functionality during cleanup

## Strategic Shift to Service Mediator Pattern

Based on our experience with circular dependencies and test timeouts, we've developed a comprehensive strategic plan to address these issues systematically. The key components are:

1. **Service Mediator Pattern** - Implementing a dedicated mediator service to break circular dependencies between services
2. **Enhanced Test Framework** - Improving test isolation and memory management
3. **Specialized Testing Patterns** - Creating patterns for testing transformation scenarios
4. **Timeout Management** - Adding explicit timeout handling for complex tests

See [circular-dependency-strategic-plan.md](./reference/circular-dependency-strategic-plan.md) for the detailed implementation plan.

## Recent Achievements

### DI-Only Mode Implementation (✅ Complete)

We've successfully implemented the opt-in mechanism for DI-only mode:

1. Added `diOnlyMode` option to TestContextDI
2. Updated `shouldUseDI()` to check for the MIGRATE_TO_DI_ONLY environment variable
3. Added `TestContextDI.withDIOnlyMode()` helper method for easy adoption
4. Created proper environment variable cleanup in the TestContextDI.cleanup() method

### Test Migration Tools (✅ Complete)

We've created tools to assist with the migration process:

1. Created a verification script (`scripts/verify-di-only-mode.js`) that:
   - Tests files in DI-only mode
   - Records pass/fail results
   - Updates a migration status summary
2. Established a tracking system in `_dev/issues/features/tsyringe/tracking/`
3. Created a migration plan with batches of tests to migrate
4. Set up an example migration pattern for test authors to follow

### Test Migration Progress (🔄 In Progress)

We've begun migrating tests to DI-only mode:

1. Successfully fixed all FileSystemService test failures (3 of them):
   - PathOperationsService.test.ts - Works in all three modes with minimal changes
   - FileSystemService.test.ts - Fixed by customizing the FileSystemService setup for DI-only mode
   - NodeFileSystem.test.ts - Already works with DI-only mode without changes
2. Updated tracking documentation to reflect progress (50% of foundation tests now passing, 7.7% overall)
3. Identified key patterns for successful test migration:
   - Custom service initialization with proper path resolution for tests
   - Simpler test approach focusing on core functionality
   - Careful handling of path variables with $PROJECTPATH format
4. The key challenge we addressed was proper path resolution in the FileSystemService:
   - Added a custom override of the resolvePath method to handle $PROJECTPATH paths
   - Simplified file operation tests to focus just on the functionality
   - Made sure the file operations work with the variable-based paths

## Next Steps

1. Continue migrating the remaining foundation services in Batch 1
2. ✅ Fixed: PathService tests memory issues - resolved by:
   - Removing dynamic imports to meld-ast parser to prevent memory leaks
   - Creating a simplified mock parser that handles just the test cases
   - Supporting three test modes (DI, no-DI, DI-only) in the same test file
   - Making sure path resolution works correctly in DI-only mode
   - Implementing better test cleanup for isolation
3. Update the tracking documentation as tests are fixed
4. Continue until all tests in Batch 1 pass, then move to Batch 2

## Avoiding Common Pitfalls

⚠️ **DO NOT** force DI-only mode by changing `shouldUseDI()` to always return true without first updating all relevant tests.

⚠️ **DO NOT** attempt to update all services at once. Work on one at a time and verify tests pass.

⚠️ **DO NOT** modify core test infrastructure without thorough testing.
