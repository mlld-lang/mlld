# Prettier Integration Implementation Summary

## Implementation Status

We have successfully completed Phase 1 of the plan from PLAN-NEWLINES-2.md, which involves adding Prettier integration while maintaining both output modes for backward compatibility.

### Completed Tasks:

1. Added Prettier as a dependency:
   ```bash
   npm install prettier --save
   ```

2. Created the prettierUtils.ts utility:
   - Created `/Users/adam/dev/claude-meld/core/utils/prettierUtils.ts`
   - Implemented `formatWithPrettier` function with proper error handling
   - Added unit tests in `prettierUtils.test.ts`

3. Updated Core Types:
   - Added `pretty` option to `ProcessOptions` interface in `/Users/adam/dev/claude-meld/core/types/index.ts`
   - Added `pretty` option to `OutputOptions` interface in `/Users/adam/dev/claude-meld/services/pipeline/OutputService/IOutputService.ts`

4. Updated OutputService Implementation:
   - Modified the `convert` method in `/Users/adam/dev/claude-meld/services/pipeline/OutputService/OutputService.ts`
   - Added logic to use Prettier when the `pretty` option is enabled
   - Ensured correct parser selection based on output format (markdown or html for xml)
   - Added comprehensive tests for the Prettier integration

5. Updated CLI to support the --pretty flag:
   - Added the `pretty` option to `CLIOptions` in `/Users/adam/dev/claude-meld/cli/index.ts`
   - Updated `parseArgs` to handle the `--pretty` flag
   - Updated `displayHelp` to document the new flag
   - Updated `cliToApiOptions` to pass the pretty flag to the API

6. Updated API run-meld.ts:
   - Added `pretty: false` to default options
   - Updated the OutputService call to pass the pretty option
   - Modified post-processing logic to skip when Prettier is enabled
   - Added comments for future phase 2 cleanup

7. Added Tests:
   - Added tests for prettierUtils.ts
   - Added tests for Prettier integration in OutputService
   - All tests pass

### Approach:
- We maintained backward compatibility by keeping existing code paths
- We added the `pretty` option as an alternative to the existing `output-normalized` mode
- We ensured that only one type of formatting is applied (either Prettier or legacy post-processing)
- We used spies in the tests to verify that Prettier is called correctly

### Next Steps:
1. Proceed with Phase 2 - Remove output-normalized mode
2. Proceed with Phase 3 - Standardize terminology

This implementation gives users the option to use Prettier for formatting while maintaining backward compatibility with existing code. The pretty option is available in both the CLI and the API.
