# TSyringe Dependency Injection Migration - Review Findings

## Overview
This document outlines potential issues identified during the review of the TSyringe dependency injection migration PR. While the migration has been completed and merged, these concerns should be addressed in follow-up work to ensure the codebase remains maintainable and robust.

## Identified Concerns

### 1. Node Platform Configuration Removal
The removal of the Node.js platform configuration (`options.platform = 'node'`) may cause build issues if the bundler relies on this setting to properly handle Node.js-specific code. This could lead to runtime errors if the bundled code assumes browser APIs are available.

### 2. Dependency Management
The diff shows removal of Node.js built-in module imports while only adding 'yargs'. If these modules are still used in the codebase, they need to be properly declared somewhere to avoid potential runtime errors.

### 3. Service Mediator Pattern Implementation
While the Service Mediator pattern was implemented to break circular dependencies, there are concerns about:
- The mediator potentially becoming a "god object" with too many responsibilities
- Whether it genuinely resolves circular dependencies rather than just hiding them
- Excessive indirection that makes the code harder to follow

Note: This is addressed in the existing issue `cleanup-service-mediator.md`.

### 4. Test Infrastructure
With the shift to DI, test infrastructure complexity increases. Potential issues include:
- Tests artificially passing due to shared state between tests
- TestContainerHelper not properly resetting container state between tests
- Incorrect mocking and cleanup of dependencies

### 5. Interface-First Design
The architecture document emphasizes interface-first design, but concerns include:
- Consistent implementation of interfaces with clear contracts
- Adherence to naming conventions (I[Name]Service pattern)
- Appropriate scoping of interface exposures

### 6. Migration Completeness
Verification is needed to ensure:
- All conditional logic for non-DI mode is truly removed
- Services consistently use constructor injection rather than property injection
- Circular dependencies are properly resolved, not just worked around

Note: Parts of this are addressed in the existing issue `cleanup-dual-mode-di.md`.

## Next Steps
Each of these concerns will be investigated thoroughly to determine their validity and severity. Additional cleanup issues will be created for any confirmed problems that aren't already covered by existing cleanup tickets.
