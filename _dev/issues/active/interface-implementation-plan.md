# Interface Standardization Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan for completing Phase 3 of the DI cleanup project - Interface Standardization.

## Progress So Far

We have already completed:
- Initial assessment of interface naming patterns
- Documentation of the architectural distinction between I[Name]Service and I[Name] interfaces
- Comprehensive documentation updates for several key interfaces:
  - IFileSystemService
  - IStateService
  - IParserService
  - IDirectiveService

## Remaining Interfaces to Document

Based on our assessment, the following interfaces still need documentation improvements:

### Core Services
1. ✅ IFileSystemService
2. ✅ IStateService
3. ✅ IParserService
4. ✅ IDirectiveService
5. IInterpreterService
6. IPathService
7. IPathOperationsService
8. IResolutionService
9. IValidationService
10. ICircularityService
11. IOutputService
12. IStateEventService

### Secondary Services
13. ICLIService
14. IErrorDisplayService

## Implementation Approach

For each interface, we'll follow this standardized approach:

1. **Add Class-Level JSDoc**:
   - Clear description of service purpose
   - Remarks section with deeper architectural context
   - Dependencies section listing all service dependencies

2. **Improve Method Documentation**:
   - Add/update parameter descriptions using param - syntax
   - Ensure return value documentation is present
   - Add throws documentation for error cases
   - Add examples for complex methods

3. **Review Interface Scope**:
   - Identify any implementation details that should be removed
   - Consider moving internal methods to the implementation class
   - Ensure interface only exposes necessary methods

4. **Make Dependencies Explicit**:
   - Document dependency relationships in JSDoc
   - Update initialization methods to clearly show dependencies

5. **Test Mock Compatibility**:
   - Review test mocks to ensure they implement the interface correctly
   - Update mocks if needed to maintain type safety

## Implementation Order

We'll implement the changes in the following order, prioritizing core dependencies first:

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Already Completed)
1. ✅ IFileSystemService
2. ✅ IStateService

### Phase 2: Pipeline Services (In Progress)
3. ✅ IParserService
4. ✅ IDirectiveService
5. IInterpreterService
6. IPathService
7. IPathOperationsService

### Phase 3: Resolution Services
8. IResolutionService
9. IValidationService
10. ICircularityService

### Phase 4: Output and Event Services
11. IOutputService
12. IStateEventService

### Phase 5: Secondary Services
13. ICLIService
14. IErrorDisplayService

## Pull Request Strategy

We'll create PRs in manageable batches to avoid overwhelmingly large changes:

1. PR #1: Core Infrastructure (already completed)
2. PR #2: Pipeline Services (in progress)
3. PR #3: Resolution Services
4. PR #4: Output, Event, and Secondary Services

Each PR will include comprehensive documentation updates, scope reviews, and any necessary test mock updates.

## Exit Criteria

Phase 3 will be considered complete when:
- All interfaces have comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- No implementation details are exposed in interfaces
- All dependencies are explicitly documented in interfaces
- All test mocks properly implement the interfaces
- Interface design patterns are documented for developers
- All tests pass with the improved interfaces

## Timeline

- Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure): Completed
- Phase 2 (Pipeline Services): In progress, target completion by end of week
- Phase 3 (Resolution Services): Target completion within 1 week
- Phase 4 (Output and Event Services): Target completion within 1 week
- Phase 5 (Secondary Services): Target completion within 1 week

Total estimated time to completion: 3-4 weeks
