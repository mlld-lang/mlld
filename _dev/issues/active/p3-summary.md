# Phase 3: Client Interface Enhancement for Resolution Services

This phase focused on enhancing the variable resolution client interface with improved field access capabilities and context-aware formatting.

## Key Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Field Access**:
   - Implemented type-preserving field access through the resolver client
   - Added support for accessing array elements and nested object properties
   - Improved error handling and reporting for field access operations

2. **Context-Aware Formatting**:
   - Added formatting rules for different data types based on context
   - Implemented special handling for arrays and objects in block vs. inline contexts
   - Added line position awareness for proper newline handling

3. **Client Interface Improvements**:
   - Extended the `IVariableReferenceResolverClient` interface with new methods:
     - `resolveFieldAccess` - Access fields with type preservation
     - `accessFields` - Direct field access on values
     - `convertToString` - Context-aware string conversion
     - `extractReferences` - Extract variable references from text

4. **Type Preservation**:
   - Added the `preserveType` option to maintain original data types
   - Implemented deep cloning for object and array values
   - Prevented accidental type conversion during resolution

## Formatting Standards

Updated the formatting standards document to include detailed rules for:

1. **String Values**:
   - Rendered as-is in all contexts
   - Special handling for multi-line strings

2. **Array Values**:
   - Block context: Bullet list with one item per line
   - Inline context: Comma-separated values
   - Code fence context: Pretty-printed JSON

3. **Object Values**:
   - Block context: Fenced code block with JSON
   - Inline context: Compact JSON string
   - Code fence context: Pretty-printed JSON without fences

4. **Line Position Awareness**:
   - Start of line: No leading newline needed
   - Middle/End of line: Leading newline added for multi-line formatting

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests for the new functionality:

1. `enhanced-field-access.test.ts`: Tests the client interface and formatting behavior
2. Updated existing tests to handle type preservation correctly
3. Verified backward compatibility with existing code

## Implementation Details

1. The resolver client factory now creates clients with the full suite of enhanced methods
2. The `convertToString` method was extended with context-aware formatting logic
3. The variable reference resolver was improved to handle type preservation
4. Added deep cloning of objects and arrays to prevent accidental mutations

## Next Steps (Phase 4)

The next phase will focus on OutputService DI Refactoring:
1. Update OutputService to use the VariableReferenceResolverClient
2. Fix transformation mode handling with data type preservation
3. Improve nodeToMarkdown with proper context tracking
4. Remove any remaining regex-based workarounds from the pipeline
