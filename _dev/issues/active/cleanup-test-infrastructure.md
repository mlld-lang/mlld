# Improve Test Infrastructure After DI Migration

## Background
The TSyringe dependency injection migration introduced a complex test infrastructure with dual-mode support, container management, and service mocking utilities. Now that the migration is complete, the test infrastructure should be simplified and improved to ensure test reliability.

## Problem
The current test infrastructure has several issues:
1. **Shared State:** Tests may inadvertently share state through the DI container, leading to flaky tests
2. **Container Reset Complexity:** TestContainerHelper has complex reset logic with potential edge cases
3. **Verbose Test Setup:** Tests require verbose setup code to configure container and mock services
4. **Multiple Test Context Implementations:** Both TestContext and TestContextDI exist in parallel
5. **Conditional DI Mode Testing:** Tests use environment variables to toggle between DI modes
6. **Error-prone Mock Registration:** Mock registration relies on manual tracking of registrations

## Proposed Solution
1. Simplify the TestContainerHelper to focus on isolated container creation
2. Implement automatic container reset between tests to prevent shared state
3. Create a unified TestContext that exclusively uses DI
4. Add helper methods for common mock patterns to reduce boilerplate
5. Improve container debugging tools to detect stale state between tests
6. Ensure all tests use proper cleanup to prevent resource leaks

## Implementation Steps
1. Audit existing test patterns to identify common mock configurations
2. Update TestContextDI to include enhanced debugging capabilities
3. Add automated detection of container state leakage between tests
4. Simplify mock registration methods to reduce verbosity
5. Update TestContext to delegate to TestContextDI internally
6. Add test lifecycle hooks for automatic cleanup
7. Create development guide for testing best practices

## Success Criteria
- Zero tests with flaky behavior due to shared state
- Significantly reduced test setup boilerplate
- Unified test context with simpler API
- Automatic container isolation between tests
- Clear error messages for container state leaks
- Comprehensive test documentation

## Estimated Complexity
Medium - Requires careful updates to core test infrastructure without breaking existing tests
