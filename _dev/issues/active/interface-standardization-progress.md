# Interface Standardization Progress Report

This document tracks our progress on Phase 3 (Interface Standardization) of the TSyringe Dependency Injection Cleanup Plan.

## Completed Interfaces

We have standardized the following interfaces with comprehensive documentation:

1. âœ… **IFileSystemService** - Core file system service interface  
   - Added comprehensive class-level documentation
   - Documented all methods with parameters, return values, and examples
   - Made dependencies explicit (IFileSystem, IPathService)

2. âœ… **IStateService** - Core state management service interface
   - Added comprehensive class-level documentation
   - Documented all methods (70+) with parameters, return values, and throws declarations
   - Made dependencies explicit (IStateEventService, IStateTrackingService)
   - Improved documentation of TransformationOptions interface

3. âœ… **IParserService** - Parser service interface
   - Added comprehensive class-level documentation
   - Added examples for parse and parseWithLocations methods
   - Made dependencies explicit (meld-ast)

4. âœ… **IDirectiveService** - Directive handling service interface
   - Added comprehensive class-level documentation
   - Documented all methods with parameters, return values, and throws declarations
   - Made dependencies explicit (8 service dependencies)
   - Improved documentation of DirectiveContext and IDirectiveHandler interfaces

5. âœ… **IInterpreterService** - Interpreter service interface
   - Added comprehensive class-level documentation
   - Documented all methods with parameters, return values, and examples
   - Made dependencies explicit (IDirectiveService, IStateService)
   - Improved documentation of InterpreterOptions and ErrorHandler interfaces

## In Progress

We are working on standardizing the following interfaces:

1. ðŸ”„ **IPathService** - Path validation and resolution service
2. ðŸ”„ **IPathOperationsService** - Path utility operations service

## Planning

We have created comprehensive implementation plans:

1. âœ… **interface-implementation-plan.md** - Detailed plan for completing all interfaces
2. âœ… **interface-standardization-progress.md** - Progress tracking document

## Next Steps

1. Continue with the Pipeline Services interfaces:
   - IPathService
   - IPathOperationsService

2. Move on to Resolution Services:
   - IResolutionService
   - IValidationService
   - ICircularityService

3. Complete Output and Event Services:
   - IOutputService
   - IStateEventService

4. Finalize with Secondary Services:
   - ICLIService
   - IErrorDisplayService

## Pull Requests

We plan to create the following PRs:

1. PR #1: Pipeline Services (IParserService, IDirectiveService, IInterpreterService, IPathService, IPathOperationsService)
2. PR #2: Resolution Services (IResolutionService, IValidationService, ICircularityService)
3. PR #3: Output, Event, and Secondary Services (IOutputService, IStateEventService, ICLIService, IErrorDisplayService)

## Timeline

We are on track to complete all interface standardization within 3-4 weeks.
