# ServiceMediator Removal Project

## Overview

This project aims to replace the ServiceMediator pattern with a factory pattern for resolving circular dependencies in the Meld codebase. The ServiceMediator was implemented as a transitional solution during the TSyringe dependency injection migration, but it has several architectural drawbacks that we now need to address.

## Motivation

The ServiceMediator pattern has served us well during the DI migration, but it comes with significant drawbacks:

1. **Tight Coupling**: Multiple services are coupled to a single mediator, creating a central point of failure.
2. **Hidden Dependencies**: The true dependencies between services are obscured by the mediator.
3. **Null Check Proliferation**: Services must constantly check if the mediator and its services are initialized.
4. **Testing Complexity**: Testing requires mocking the entire mediator and all its methods.
5. **Maintenance Overhead**: Changes to one service interface can affect multiple components.

## Target Architecture: Factory Pattern

We will replace the ServiceMediator with a factory pattern that:

1. **Creates focused interfaces** that expose only the methods needed by each service
2. **Makes dependencies explicit** in service constructors
3. **Eliminates null checks** by ensuring dependencies exist when needed
4. **Simplifies testing** with smaller, more focused interfaces
5. **Reduces coupling** between services

### Analysis Documents

- [Circular Dependencies Analysis](./circular-dependencies-analysis.md) - Comprehensive analysis of circular dependencies in the codebase
- [FileSystemService â†” PathService Implementation Plan](./filesystem-path-factory-implementation-plan.md) - Detailed implementation plan for the first circular dependency

### Architecture Documents

## Implementation Phases

The project is divided into five phases:

### Phase 1: Preparation and Analysis âœ…

- Identify all circular dependencies in the codebase
- Document methods used through the ServiceMediator
- Design minimal client interfaces
- Create implementation plan

### Phase 2: Prototype Implementation (In Progress)

- Implement factory pattern for FileSystemService â†” PathService
- Create client interfaces and factories
- Update services to use factories
- Run tests to verify functionality
- Document implementation pattern

### Phase 3: Incremental Implementation

- Implement factory pattern for ParserService â†” ResolutionService
- Implement factory pattern for StateService â†” StateTrackingService
- Implement factory pattern for any other identified circular dependencies
- Run tests after each implementation

### Phase 4: ServiceMediator Deprecation

- Mark ServiceMediator as deprecated
- Update services to prefer factories over ServiceMediator
- Add logging when ServiceMediator methods are used
- Update tests to use factories instead of ServiceMediator

### Phase 5: ServiceMediator Removal

- Remove ServiceMediator usage from services
- Remove ServiceMediator class and interface
- Update DI configuration
- Run comprehensive test suite
- Update documentation

## Benefits

The factory pattern approach will bring several benefits to the codebase:

1. **Clear Dependencies**: Services explicitly state what they need through focused interfaces
2. **Interface Segregation**: Services only get access to the specific methods they need
3. **No Null Checks**: Factory creates clients at initialization time, eliminating null checks
4. **Simpler Testing**: Small, focused interfaces are easier to mock
5. **Reduced Tight Coupling**: Services are coupled only to minimal interfaces, not to a central mediator
6. **Improved Code Readability**: Code intent becomes clearer when using direct method calls
7. **Better Maintainability**: Changes to service interfaces won't affect all dependent services

## Backward Compatibility

Throughout the implementation, we will maintain backward compatibility by:

1. Keeping the ServiceMediator registration and usage
2. Adding the factory pattern as an alternative
3. Preferring the factory pattern when available
4. Falling back to the ServiceMediator when the factory is not available

This approach ensures that existing code continues to work while we transition to the new pattern.

## Contributing

If you're working on this project, please follow these guidelines:

1. Make small, focused commits that address specific issues
2. Include comprehensive tests with each change
3. Document architectural decisions and their rationale
4. Run the full test suite after each significant change
5. Update documentation alongside code changes
