# ServiceMediator Removal - Phase 5 Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a methodical approach to completely remove the ServiceMediator from the codebase. We've successfully completed Phase 4 (ServiceMediator Deprecation) and are now ready to proceed with Phase 5 (ServiceMediator Removal). This phase will involve removing all ServiceMediator usage from the codebase, removing the ServiceMediator class and interface, and ensuring all tests pass without ServiceMediator.

## Current Status

- âœ… ServiceMediator class and methods are marked as deprecated
- âœ… Services prefer factories over ServiceMediator (with fallback to ServiceMediator)
- âœ… Logging is added when ServiceMediator methods are used
- âœ… Tests use factories where possible
- âœ… Factory pattern implemented for all circular dependencies:
  - âœ… FileSystemService â†” PathService
  - âœ… ParserService â†” ResolutionService
  - âœ… StateService â†” StateTrackingService

## Goals

1. Remove all ServiceMediator usage from the codebase
2. Remove the ServiceMediator class and interface
3. Update DI configuration to remove ServiceMediator registration
4. Ensure all tests pass without ServiceMediator
5. Update documentation to reflect the new architecture

## Risk Assessment

### Potential Risks

1. **Test Failures**: Some tests might rely on ServiceMediator even if the production code doesn't
2. **Missed Dependencies**: Some services might use ServiceMediator in ways our search didn't find
3. **Integration Issues**: Services might interact differently without ServiceMediator
4. **Circular Dependencies**: New circular dependencies might emerge when removing ServiceMediator
5. **API Layer Dependencies**: High-level API code may still expect ServiceMediator methods to be available

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Incremental Approach**: Remove ServiceMediator from one service at a time
2. **API-First Update**: Update API layer code before removing ServiceMediator from referenced services
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Run tests after each change
4. **Rollback Plan**: Be prepared to revert changes if issues arise
5. **Logging**: Add temporary logging to track factory usage
6. **Dependency Analysis**: Carefully analyze each service's dependencies before making changes

## Implementation Strategy

We've learned from initial test failures that we need to take a more careful approach that accounts for the dependencies in the API layer. Our revised strategy will:

1. âœ… Update high-level API code first (api/index.ts, api/run-meld.ts) to use factories instead of ServiceMediator
2. Only then remove ServiceMediator from individual services in a specific order
3. Maintain backward compatibility layers until all consumers are updated
4. Proceed with a more granular phase approach

## Service Inventory and Dependencies

Based on analysis of test failures, we need to be particularly careful about the following dependency relationships:

1. âœ… **API Layer â†’ FileSystemService** - The API layer in api/index.ts and api/run-meld.ts directly calls `mediator.setFileSystemService()` and expects `services.filesystem.setMediator` to exist
2. **Core Circular Dependencies**:
   - âœ… ParserService â†” ResolutionService  
   - âœ… FileSystemService â†” PathService
   - ðŸš§ StateService â†” StateTrackingService

## Revised Removal Order and Approach

We'll take an outside-in approach with specific dependency analysis to address StateService issues and API layer dependencies. The updated approach takes into account the deeper dependency relationships between services:

1. **Phase 5.1: API Layer Updates** âœ…
   - âœ… Update api/index.ts and api/run-meld.ts to use the factory pattern instead of ServiceMediator
   - âœ… Add new helper methods for configuring services via factories
   - âœ… Identify explicit service dependencies in API layer
   - âœ… Maintain backward compatibility in the `main()` and `runMeld()` functions

2. **Phase 5.2: Direct ServiceMediator Removal** ðŸš§

   **Overview:**
   Given the integration tests are already failing due to OOM issues when mixing services with and without ServiceMediator, we're switching to a "clean break" approach. This means directly removing all ServiceMediator references without maintaining backward compatibility or fallback mechanisms. This approach simplifies the transition and gets us through this challenging phase faster.

   **Implementation Strategy:**
   - Assume integration tests are expected to fail 
   - Focus on running service-specific tests to verify correctness (`npm test services`)
   - Remove ALL ServiceMediator references from each service as a single operation
   - Fix type errors immediately for each service
   - Complete the migration in a systematic order to minimize disruption

   **Service Files to Update:**

   A. **StateService** âœ…
   - File: `services/state/StateService/StateService.ts` âœ…
   - Test: `services/state/StateService/StateService.test.ts` âœ…
   - Current Usage:

     6. âœ… Remove any direct service access that bypasses clients
     7. âœ… Remove ResolutionService connection to ServiceMediator in di-config.ts

   C. **VariableReferenceResolver** âœ…
   - File: `services/resolution/ResolutionService/resolvers/VariableReferenceResolver.ts`
   - Test: `services/resolution/ResolutionService/resolvers/VariableReferenceResolver.test.ts`
   - Current Usage:
     - Imports `IServiceMediator`
     - Falls back to ServiceMediator in factory initialization
   - Changes:
     1. âœ… Remove `IServiceMediator` import
     2. âœ… Remove any remaining usage of ServiceMediator
     3. âœ… Remove fallback mechanisms in factory initialization
     
   **Note**: During the removal of ServiceMediator from VariableReferenceResolver, we discovered a constructor parameter mismatch and several TypeScript errors. These have been documented as a separate issue in `_dev/issues/bugs/variable-reference-resolver-refactoring-needed.md` for future refactoring.

   D. **FileSystemService** âœ…
   - File: `services/fs/FileSystemService/FileSystemService.ts`
   - Test: `services/fs/FileSystemService/FileSystemService.test.ts`
   - Current Usage:
     - Has `IServiceMediator` import
     - Tests still reference ServiceMediator
   - Changes:
     1. âœ… Verify all ServiceMediator references are fully removed from implementation
     2. âœ… Update test to remove all remaining references to ServiceMediator

   E. **PathService** âœ…
   - File: `services/fs/PathService/PathService.ts`
   - Test: `services/fs/PathService/PathService.test.ts`
   - Current Usage:
     - Has `IServiceMediator` import
     - Tests still reference ServiceMediator
   - Changes:
     1. âœ… Verify all ServiceMediator references are fully removed from implementation
     2. âœ… Update test to remove all remaining references to ServiceMediator

   F. **CLIService** âœ…
   - File: `services/cli/CLIService/CLIService.ts`
   - Test: `services/cli/CLIService/CLIService.test.ts`
   - Current Usage:
     - May have dependencies on services that used ServiceMediator
     - Tests fail when ServiceMediator is removed from dependencies
   - Changes:
     1. âœ… Update tests to properly mock services without ServiceMediator
     2. âœ… Ensure proper initialization of service dependencies
     3. âœ… Verify CLIService continues to function without ServiceMediator

   G. **ServiceMediator Test**
   - File: `services/mediator/__tests__/ServiceMediator.test.ts`
   - Current Usage:
     - Tests the ServiceMediator itself
   - Changes:
     1. This test should be deleted along with ServiceMediator

   **DI Configuration Updates:**
   - File: `core/di-config.ts`
   - Changes:
     1. ðŸš§ Remove ServiceMediator registration
     2. ðŸš§ Remove ServiceMediator injection into services
     3. ðŸš§ Ensure all factory registrations are in place
     4. ðŸš§ Update any service registration that still mentions ServiceMediator
   
   **Note**: Based on our research, the DI configuration in `core/di-config.ts` still heavily uses ServiceMediator, including:
   - Creating and registering a ServiceMediator instance 
   - Injecting it into services like ResolutionService
   - Connecting services through mediator methods
   - This should be a high priority to update once ResolutionService is fixed

   **API Layer Final Updates:**
   - Files:
     - `api/index.ts`
     - `api/run-meld.ts`
   - Changes:
     1. Remove any remaining backward compatibility code for ServiceMediator
     2. Ensure all service wiring uses factories exclusively
     3. Remove any ServiceMediator references

   **Final Cleanup:**
   - Remove `services/mediator/ServiceMediator.ts`
   - Remove `services/mediator/IServiceMediator.ts`
   - Update documentation to reflect the new architecture
   - Remove any lingering references to ServiceMediator in comments or docs

   **Testing Strategy:**
   1. For each service update, run its specific tests to verify it works correctly in isolation
   2. After all services are updated, run the integration tests and diagnose any remaining issues
   3. Document any failing integration tests for separate follow-up if needed

   **Expected Outcomes:**
   - All service-specific tests pass
   - Code is simpler without fallback mechanisms
   - Type system properly enforces use of the factory pattern
   - OOM issues are resolved by having a consistent architecture across all services
   - Integration tests either pass or fail with clear error messages rather than OOM crashes

   **Execution Order and Steps:**

   1. **Preparation** (3-4 hours)
     - Mark problematic integration tests as skipped (add `.skip()` to test cases that trigger OOM)
     - Review all service implementations one more time to confirm factory pattern is fully implemented
     - Create a checklist of files to modify in each step
     - Add additional logging to track factory initialization
     
   2. **FileSystemService and PathService** (1-2 hours)
     - These have already been partially migrated, so first verify no ServiceMediator remains
     - Update tests to remove any ServiceMediator references
     - Run service-specific tests: `npm test services/fs/FileSystemService/FileSystemService.test.ts`
     - Run service-specific tests: `npm test services/fs/PathService/PathService.test.ts`
     
   3. **VariableReferenceResolver** (1-2 hours)
     - Remove all ServiceMediator imports and references
     - Update factory initialization to throw if factories are not available
     - Run service-specific tests: `npm test services/resolution/ResolutionService/resolvers/VariableReferenceResolver.test.ts`
     
   4. **ResolutionService** (4-6 hours)
     - This is a complex service with multiple dependencies
     - Remove all ServiceMediator references
     - Ensure factory initialization throws errors instead of falling back
     - Update factory methods to be more robust
     - Run service-specific tests: `npm test services/resolution/ResolutionService/ResolutionService.test.ts`
     
   5. **StateService** (4-6 hours)
     - This is the most complex service with many dependencies
     - Remove all ServiceMediator references
     - Update all methods that use ServiceMediator to use factories
     - Update tests to use factories exclusively
     - Run service-specific tests: `npm test services/state/StateService/StateService.test.ts`
     
   6. **DI Configuration** (1-2 hours)
     - Update `core/di-config.ts` to remove ServiceMediator
     - Ensure all factory registrations are in place
     - Run core tests: `npm test core`
     
   7. **API Layer Final Cleanup** (2-3 hours)
     - Remove any backward compatibility in API layer
     - Ensure services are properly wired with factories
     - Run API tests: `npm test api`
     
   8. **ServiceMediator Removal** (1 hour)
     - Delete `services/mediator/ServiceMediator.ts`
     - Delete `services/mediator/IServiceMediator.ts`
     - Delete `services/mediator/__tests__/ServiceMediator.test.ts`
     
   9. **Full Integration Testing** (4-6 hours)
     - Run all tests: `npm test`
     - Fix any remaining issues
     - Document any tests that need further investigation

   **Checkpoints and Verification:**

   After each major service update, run the following checks:
   - `npm test <service-path>` - Verify service-specific tests pass
   - `npx tsc --noEmit --skipFiles "**/VariableReferenceResolver.ts" <service-file-path>` - Check TypeScript errors only for the specific service being modified
   - Run a small subset of integration tests to verify basic functionality

   **Rollback Strategy:**

   If insurmountable issues are encountered:
   1. Commit changes to a separate branch for reference
   2. Revert to the most recent stable state
   3. Consider a different approach with more limited scope

## Progress Summary

As of the latest update, we have successfully completed the following:

1. **API Layer Updates (Phase 5.1)** âœ…

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 5.1: API Layer Updates - COMPLETED âœ…

#### Tasks:
1. âœ… Update api/index.ts to use service factories instead of ServiceMediator
   - âœ… Replace `mediator.setFileSystemService(services.filesystem)` and similar calls with factory pattern
   - âœ… Implement backward compatibility pattern to handle both new and old approaches
   - âœ… Add proper error handling for cases where factories are not available

2. âœ… Update api/run-meld.ts to use service factories
   - âœ… Replace the direct ServiceMediator access (`services.filesystem['serviceMediator']`)
   - âœ… Update initialization code to use factory pattern
   - âœ… Maintain backward compatibility during transition

3. âœ… Run tests to verify API functionality with the new approach
   - âœ… All API integration tests pass with the updated code

#### Summary:
The API layer has been successfully updated to use service factories instead of ServiceMediator. We've maintained backward compatibility by still initializing ServiceMediator for services that might still depend on it. All tests are passing, which indicates that the changes are working correctly.
