# Enforce Consistent Interface-First Design

## Background
The architecture document emphasizes interface-first design as a core principle of the codebase, with services defined by interfaces (I[Name]Service) that are then implemented by concrete classes. While the TSyringe migration made progress toward this goal, there are inconsistencies in the implementation.

## Problem
The current interface-first implementation has several issues:
1. **Inconsistent Naming:** Some services follow the I[Name]Service pattern while others don't
2. **Interface Scope:** Some interfaces expose implementation details that should be private
3. **Incomplete Separation:** Some services still combine interface and implementation concerns
4. **Missing Interface Documentation:** Many interfaces lack comprehensive documentation
5. **Implicit Dependencies:** Not all interfaces explicitly declare their dependencies
6. **Test Utilities:** Test mocks don't fully leverage interfaces for type safety

## Proposed Solution
1. Standardize all service interfaces to follow the I[Name]Service pattern
2. Audit interface definitions to ensure they only expose necessary methods
3. Complete the separation of interfaces and implementations for all services
4. Improve interface documentation with examples and usage patterns
5. Explicitly declare dependencies in interfaces using the established pattern
6. Update test utilities to properly leverage interfaces for mocking

## Implementation Steps
1. Create a comprehensive audit of all service interfaces
2. Establish a coding standard for interface design
3. Refactor interfaces that don't follow naming conventions
4. Update interface documentation to be more comprehensive
5. Create interface validation utilities to ensure compliance
6. Update test mocks to align with interface definitions
7. Document the interface-first approach in the developer guide

## Success Criteria
- All service interfaces follow consistent I[Name]Service naming
- Interfaces only expose necessary public methods
- All interfaces have complete documentation with examples
- Dependency declarations are explicit and consistent
- Test mocks leverage interfaces for improved type safety
- Developers can easily understand service contracts through interfaces

## Estimated Complexity
Medium - Requires careful refactoring of interface definitions without breaking functionality
