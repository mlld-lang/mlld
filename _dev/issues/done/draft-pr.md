# TSyringe DI Cleanup: Phases 1-5 Complete

## Summary
- Completes the comprehensive TSyringe Dependency Injection cleanup (Phases 1-5) outlined in issue #3
- Implements a complete factory pattern approach for circular dependencies, replacing ServiceMediator
- Standardizes interfaces across the codebase with proper documentation and type safety
- Simplifies test infrastructure and removes dual-mode DI support
- Adds comprehensive architectural documentation in `docs/dev/DI-ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Major Accomplishments

### Phase 1: Build Configuration Cleanup
- Restored proper Node.js platform settings in build targets
- Updated external dependencies across build configurations
- Configured proper handling of TSyringe and reflect-metadata

### Phase 2: Test Infrastructure Simplification
- Removed conditional DI mode in test utilities
- Simplified TestContainerHelper for isolated container creation
- Implemented automatic container reset between tests
- Added container state leak detection
- Created unified helper methods for common test patterns

### Phase 3: Interface Standardization
- Documented interface architecture (I[Name]Service vs I[Name] patterns)
- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments to all interfaces
- Standardized interface scopes and removed exposure of implementation details
- Made dependencies explicitly declared in interfaces

### Phase 4: Dual-Mode DI Removal
- Completely removed dual-mode DI support
- Simplified service constructors while maintaining compatibility
- Updated all tests to use DI-only approach
- Fixed DI-related test issues across the codebase

### Phase 5: ServiceMediator Replacement
- Replaced ServiceMediator with factory pattern for:
  - FileSystemService ↔ PathService
  - ResolutionService ↔ ParserService 
  - StateService ↔ StateTrackingService
- Created minimal client interfaces following interface segregation principles
- Implemented factory classes with proper DI registration
- Completely removed the ServiceMediator class, interface, and all related code

## Test Plan
- All 1100+ tests pass using the new architecture
- Tests have been updated to use the factory pattern approach
- Added dedicated tests for factory implementations
- Verified integration across all services

This PR represents a significant architectural improvement, resulting in:
1. Clear dependencies between services
2. More maintainable and testable codebase
3. Better type safety and error handling
4. Reduced coupling between services
5. Improved code organization following interface-first design
