9. ✅ **IValidationService** - Directive validation service
   - Added comprehensive class-level documentation
   - Documented validator registration and validation methods
   - Added examples for validator registration and directive validation
   - Made implicit interactions with other services clear

10. ✅ **ICircularityService** - Circular reference detection service

    - Documented the event system design and observer pattern implementation
    - Added examples for event handling and emission
    - Improved documentation of StateEvent, StateEventHandler, and related types
    - Clarified the service's role in state monitoring and debugging

13. ✅ **ICLIService** - Command line interface service
    - Added comprehensive class-level documentation
    - Documented CLI options and argument parsing
    - Added examples for command execution
    - Made dependencies explicit (multiple services)
    - Improved documentation of CLIOptions and IPromptService

14. ✅ **IErrorDisplayService** - Error display and formatting service
    - Added comprehensive class-level documentation
    - Documented error formatting and display methods
    - Added examples for error handling and presentation
    - Made dependencies explicit (IFileSystemService)
    - Clarified the service's role in user-friendly error presentation

## Next Steps

All interfaces have been successfully standardized! The next steps are:

1. Create pull requests for the completed interfaces
   - PR #1: Pipeline Services (IParserService, IDirectiveService, IInterpreterService, IPathService, IPathOperationsService)
   - PR #2: Resolution Services (IResolutionService, IValidationService, ICircularityService)
   - PR #3: Output, Event, and Secondary Services (IOutputService, IStateEventService, ICLIService, IErrorDisplayService)

2. Move on to Phase 4: Dual-Mode DI Removal
   - Update ServiceProvider to always use DI
   - Remove conditional logic related to DI mode
   - Simplify service constructors to assume DI

## Summary

We have successfully completed Phase 3 of the TSyringe Dependency Injection Cleanup Plan by standardizing all 14 service interfaces in the codebase. This effort has:

- Added comprehensive documentation to all service interfaces
- Made dependencies explicit in interface documentation
- Added examples to clarify interface usage
- Improved documentation of related types and options
- Clarified the role and responsibility of each service

This work significantly improves the codebase's maintainability and developer experience by providing clear, consistent, and comprehensive documentation of the service architecture.
