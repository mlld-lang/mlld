# VariableReferenceResolver Refactoring Progress

## Summary of Changes

The following refactoring tasks have been completed for the `VariableReferenceResolver`:

1. **Constructor Parameter Alignment**
   - Added explicit `parserService` parameter to match usage in tests
   - Updated import statements to include IParserService
   - Aligned constructor parameters with implementation

2. **Type Definitions**
   - Created a dedicated `types.ts` file with proper type definitions for:
     - Field interface
     - TextNode, VariableReferenceNode, TextVarNode, DataVarNode interfaces
     - Type guards for all node types

3. **Error Handling**
   - Added missing error codes to `ResolutionErrorCode` enum:
     - `FIELD_NOT_FOUND`
     - `INVALID_ACCESS`
   - Created an error factory (`error-factory.ts`) for consistent error creation
   - Updated error details interface in `MeldResolutionError.ts` to include all needed properties
   - Enhanced error handling with specific error types for each failure scenario
   - Added proper error propagation and context enrichment

4. **Factory Pattern**
   - Created a dedicated factory class (`VariableReferenceResolverFactory.ts`)
   - Registered the factory in DI container
   - Standardized resolver creation
   - Improved factory initialization with better error handling

5. **Code Quality**
   - Split regex-based parsing into a separate method for better maintainability
   - Added proper type guards for node processing
   - Improved error handling with proper error factories
   - Enhanced documentation with JSDoc comments
   - Added better logging for error scenarios and fallback paths
   - Improved node processing logic with try/catch blocks and better type handling

6. **Dependency Management**
   - Improved service client initialization with graceful fallbacks
   - Enhanced factory initialization to be more resilient
   - Added better logging for dependency resolution
   - Made service resolution more robust by trying multiple approaches

7. **Testing**
   - Created edge case tests for robust functionality verification
   - Added documentation of behavior in `VariableReferenceResolver.behavior.md`
   - Fixed existing tests to work with the refactored code
   - Verified integration test functionality

## Enhanced Features

1. **Improved Field Access**
   - Better handling of field access in objects and arrays
   - Enhanced error reporting for invalid field access
   - Better type checking for array indices vs. object fields
   - Added proper path tracking for nested fields

2. **Better Nested Variable Resolution**
   - Enhanced error handling for nested variables
   - Better error propagation and reporting
   - Improved fallback mechanisms

3. **More Robust Node Processing**
   - Better handling of different node types
   - Graceful handling of unknown node types
   - Improved error recovery in non-strict mode

## Implementation Plan Status

- ✅ **Stage 1**: Create comprehensive test suite and document behavior
- ✅ **Stage 2**: Update constructor and dependency injection approach
- ✅ **Stage 3**: Fix type definitions and interfaces
- ✅ **Stage 4**: Refactor AST node processing with proper type guards
- ✅ **Stage 5**: Improve error handling
- ✅ **Stage 6**: Testing and documentation

All identified issues have been addressed, and the refactored code is now working correctly with all tests passing. The implementation is now more robust, better typed, and has improved error handling throughout.
