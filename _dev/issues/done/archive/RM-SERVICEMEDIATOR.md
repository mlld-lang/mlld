# Strategic Plan for ServiceMediator Removal

## Overview

This document outlines a strategic, phased approach to replacing the ServiceMediator pattern with a factory pattern for resolving circular dependencies in the Meld codebase. The ServiceMediator was implemented as a transitional solution during the TSyringe dependency injection migration, but it has several architectural drawbacks that we now need to address.

## Current Challenges

The ServiceMediator pattern has served us well during the DI migration, but it comes with significant drawbacks:

1. **Tight Coupling**: Multiple services are coupled to a single mediator, creating a central point of failure.
2. **Hidden Dependencies**: The true dependencies between services are obscured by the mediator.
3. **Null Check Proliferation**: Services must constantly check if the mediator and its services are initialized.
4. **Testing Complexity**: Testing requires mocking the entire mediator and all its methods.
5. **Maintenance Overhead**: Changes to one service interface can affect multiple components.

## Target Architecture: Factory Pattern

We will replace the ServiceMediator with a factory pattern that:

1. **Creates focused interfaces** that expose only the methods needed by each service
2. **Makes dependencies explicit** in service constructors
3. **Eliminates null checks** by ensuring dependencies exist when needed
4. **Simplifies testing** with smaller, more focused interfaces
5. **Reduces coupling** between services

## Implementation Strategy

The key to success is maintaining backward compatibility throughout the transition. We must ensure that all 1100+ tests continue to pass at each step of the implementation.

## Implementation Lessons

During the implementation of the factory pattern for the FileSystemService â†” PathService circular dependency, we discovered several important lessons:

1. **Avoid Constructor Injection for Factories**: Direct constructor injection of factories can cause circular dependency issues in tests. The DI container may not have all factories registered when services are being constructed.

2. **Use Container Resolution**: Using `container.resolve()` in the constructor is more robust than constructor injection for factories. This allows services to attempt to resolve factories at runtime without requiring them to be available at construction time.

3. **Implement Robust Error Handling**: Always include try/catch blocks when using factories to handle cases where factories are not available or fail.

4. **Provide Fallback Mechanisms**: Always fall back to ServiceMediator when factories are not available or fail to ensure backward compatibility.

5. **Update Test Environment**: Ensure TestContextDI registers factory mocks to support testing with the factory pattern.

6. **Make Small, Incremental Changes**: Test after each small change to catch issues early and ensure backward compatibility is maintained.

7. **Graceful Degradation**: Services should gracefully degrade when factories are not available, ensuring that existing code continues to work during the transition.

8. **Use Lazy Initialization**: Implement lazy initialization for factories to prevent circular dependencies during service initialization:
   - Add a `factoryInitialized` flag to track whether the factory has been initialized
   - Create an `ensureFactoryInitialized()` method that initializes the factory only when needed
   - Call `ensureFactoryInitialized()` before using the client in any method
   - This approach ensures that dependencies are resolved only when actually needed, not during construction

## Detailed Implementation Example

### FileSystemService â†” PathService Implementation

#### Step 1: Create Minimal Interfaces

```typescript
// services/fs/PathService/interfaces/IPathServiceClient.ts
export interface IPathServiceClient {
  resolvePath(path: string): string;
  normalizePath(path: string): string;
}

// services/fs/FileSystemService/interfaces/IFileSystemServiceClient.ts
export interface IFileSystemServiceClient {
  isDirectory(path: string): Promise<boolean>;
  exists(path: string): Promise<boolean>;
}
```

#### Step 2: Implement Factories

```typescript
// services/fs/PathService/factories/PathServiceClientFactory.ts
@injectable()
@Service({
  description: 'Factory for creating path service clients'
})
export class PathServiceClientFactory {
  constructor(@inject('IPathService') private pathService: IPathService) {}
  
  createClient(): IPathServiceClient {
    return {
      resolvePath: (path) => this.pathService.resolvePath(path),
      normalizePath: (path) => this.pathService.normalizePath(path)
    };
  }
}

// services/fs/FileSystemService/factories/FileSystemServiceClientFactory.ts
@injectable()
@Service({
  description: 'Factory for creating file system service clients'
})
export class FileSystemServiceClientFactory {
  constructor(@inject('IFileSystemService') private fs: IFileSystemService) {}
  
  createClient(): IFileSystemServiceClient {
    return {
      isDirectory: (path) => this.fs.isDirectory(path),
      exists: (path) => this.fs.exists(path)
    };
  }
}
```

#### Step 3: Register Factories in DI Container

```typescript
// In di-config.ts
container.register('PathServiceClientFactory', { useClass: PathServiceClientFactory });
container.register('FileSystemServiceClientFactory', { useClass: FileSystemServiceClientFactory });
```

#### Step 4: Update Services to Use Factories

```typescript
// Update FileSystemService
export class FileSystemService implements IFileSystemService {
  private pathClient?: IPathServiceClient;
  private pathClientFactory?: PathServiceClientFactory;
  private factoryInitialized: boolean = false;
  
  constructor(
    @inject('IPathOperationsService') private pathOps: IPathOperationsService,
    @inject('IServiceMediator') private serviceMediator?: IServiceMediator,
    @inject('IFileSystem') private fs: IFileSystem = new NodeFileSystem()
  ) {
    // Register with mediator for backward compatibility
    if (this.serviceMediator) {
      this.serviceMediator.setFileSystemService(this);
    }
    
    // We'll initialize the factory lazily to avoid circular dependencies
    logger.debug('FileSystemService: Initialized with', {
      hasMediator: !!this.serviceMediator
    });
  }
  
  /**
   * Lazily initialize the PathServiceClient factory
   * This is called only when needed to avoid circular dependencies
   */
  private ensureFactoryInitialized(): void {
    if (this.factoryInitialized) {
      return;
    }
    
    this.factoryInitialized = true;
    
    try {
      this.pathClientFactory = container.resolve('PathServiceClientFactory');
      this.initializePathClient();
    } catch (error) {
      // Factory not available, will use mediator
      logger.debug('PathServiceClientFactory not available, using ServiceMediator for path operations');
    }
  }
  
  /**
   * Initialize the PathServiceClient using the factory
   */
  private initializePathClient(): void {
    if (!this.pathClientFactory) {
      return;
    }
    
    try {
      this.pathClient = this.pathClientFactory.createClient();
      logger.debug('Successfully created PathServiceClient using factory');
    } catch (error) {
      logger.warn('Failed to create PathServiceClient, falling back to ServiceMediator', { error });
      this.pathClient = undefined;
    }
  }
  
  private resolvePath(filePath: string): string {
    // Ensure factory is initialized before trying to use it
    this.ensureFactoryInitialized();
    
    // Try new approach first (factory pattern)
    if (this.pathClient && typeof this.pathClient.resolvePath === 'function') {
      try {
        return this.pathClient.resolvePath(filePath);
      } catch (error) {
        logger.warn('Error using pathClient.resolvePath, falling back to ServiceMediator', { 
          error, 
          path: filePath 
        });
      }
    }
    
    // Fall back to mediator for backward compatibility
    if (this.serviceMediator) {
      return this.serviceMediator.resolvePath(filePath);
    }
    
    // Last resort fallback
    logger.warn('No path resolution service available, returning unresolved path', { path: filePath });
    return filePath;
  }
}

// Update PathService similarly
```

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. **Incremental Implementation**: Implement one circular dependency at a time
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain ServiceMediator support during transition
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Run all tests after each change
4. **Logging**: Add logging to track usage of deprecated methods
5. **Rollback Plan**: Be prepared to revert changes if issues arise
6. **Documentation**: Keep documentation updated throughout the process

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Create unit tests for each new factory
2. **Integration Tests**: Ensure services work together with the new factories
3. **Regression Tests**: Run the full test suite after each change
4. **Compatibility Tests**: Verify both factory and mediator approaches work during transition
5. **Performance Tests**: Measure any performance impact of the changes

## Timeline and Resources

- **Total Duration**: 12 weeks
- **Resources Required**: 
  - 1-2 developers familiar with the codebase
  - Code reviewers for each phase
  - Test environment for continuous integration

## Success Metrics

1. **Code Quality**: Reduction in null checks and conditional logic
2. **Test Stability**: All tests pass throughout the transition
3. **Architectural Improvement**: Clearer dependencies between services
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify service relationships
5. **Complete Removal**: ServiceMediator completely removed from the codebase

## Conclusion

This phased approach to replacing the ServiceMediator with a factory pattern will improve the architecture of the Meld codebase while maintaining stability throughout the transition. By focusing on one circular dependency at a time and maintaining backward compatibility, we can ensure that all tests continue to pass at each step of the implementation.

The factory pattern provides a more modular, maintainable solution to circular dependencies that aligns with our architectural goals and dependency injection approach. Once implemented, it will make the codebase easier to understand, test, and maintain.
