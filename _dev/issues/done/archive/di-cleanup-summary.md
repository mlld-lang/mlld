# TSyringe DI Cleanup Summary

## Accomplishments

We have successfully migrated the following services to use the `TestContextDI.createIsolated()` approach:

### Core Services
- ✅ FileSystemService
- ✅ PathService
- ✅ StateService
- ✅ StateFactory
- ✅ ResolutionService
- ✅ InterpreterService
- ✅ ParserService
- ✅ DirectiveService

### Directive Handlers
- ✅ TextDirectiveHandler
- ✅ EmbedDirectiveHandler
- ✅ ImportDirectiveHandler
- ✅ RunDirectiveHandler
- ✅ DataDirectiveHandler
- ✅ DefineDirectiveHandler
- ✅ PathDirectiveHandler

## Key Improvements

1. **Isolated Test Environments**: Each test now runs in its own isolated DI container, preventing cross-test contamination.
2. **Standardized Initialization**: All services now follow a consistent pattern for initialization and cleanup.
3. **Proper Dependency Registration**: Services are registered using `context.registerMock()` instead of direct container manipulation.
4. **Circular Dependency Resolution**: Circular dependencies are properly handled through service mediators and delayed injection.
5. **Improved Test Reliability**: Tests are more reliable and less prone to flaky failures due to shared state.
6. **Better Error Messages**: When tests fail, the error messages are more descriptive and point to the actual issue.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Async Initialization**: Always use `await context.initialize()` to ensure all services are properly initialized before use.
2. **Proper Cleanup**: Always use `await context.cleanup()` in `afterEach` to prevent resource leaks.
3. **Mock Registration**: Use `context.registerMock()` instead of `container.register()` or `container.registerInstance()`.
4. **Service Resolution**: Resolve services from the container instead of creating them directly.
5. **Directive Handler Initialization**: Directive handlers require special care due to their complex initialization process.
6. **Variable Interpolation**: Use the centralized syntax from core/syntax ({{variable}}) instead of template literals (${variable}).
7. **Logger Mocking**: Focus tests on behavior verification rather than logger message assertions.
8. **Test File Content**: Ensure test files have the correct content for the service being tested.
9. **Validation Service Integration**: Ensure validation service is properly registered and initialized.
10. **Helper Functions**: Create helper functions for complex service initialization to reduce duplication.

## Best Practices

1. **Use TestContextDI.createIsolated()**: Always use this method to create a new test context.
2. **Initialize Context**: Always call `await context.initialize()` before using the context.
3. **Clean Up Context**: Always call `await context.cleanup()` in `afterEach`.
4. **Register Mocks**: Use `context.registerMock()` to register mocks.
5. **Resolve Services**: Use `context.container.resolve()` to resolve services.
6. **Use Helper Functions**: Create helper functions for complex service initialization.
7. **Focus on Behavior**: Test the behavior of services, not implementation details.
8. **Avoid Direct Container Manipulation**: Don't use `container.register()` or `container.registerInstance()` directly.
9. **Handle Circular Dependencies**: Use service mediators and delayed injection to handle circular dependencies.
10. **Document Migration Status**: Add migration status comments to test files to track progress.

## Next Steps

1. **Standardize Test Patterns**: Create a consistent pattern for all service tests.
2. **Improve Mock Factories**: Use vitest-mock-extended for more robust mocking.
3. **Simplify Test Setup**: Create helper functions to simplify the test setup process.
4. **Remove Dual-Mode DI Support**: Once all tests are migrated, remove the dual-mode DI support.
5. **Update Documentation**: Update the documentation to reflect the new testing approach.
6. **Train Team Members**: Ensure all team members understand the new testing approach.

## Conclusion

The migration to `TestContextDI.createIsolated()` has significantly improved the reliability and maintainability of our tests. By following a consistent pattern for test setup and teardown, we've reduced the likelihood of flaky tests and made it easier to understand and debug test failures. The next phase of the migration will focus on standardizing test patterns and improving mock factories to further enhance our testing infrastructure.
