# Phase 4: OutputService DI Refactoring with Direct Container Resolution

## Description

This PR implements Phase 4 of the P0 fixing plan, which focuses on refactoring the OutputService to use the VariableReferenceResolverClient for improved field access capabilities. The implementation uses a "direct container resolution" pattern to break circular dependencies between the OutputService and the resolution system.

## Key Changes

1. **Direct Container Resolution**: Implemented a pattern where the OutputService directly resolves the VariableReferenceResolverClientFactory from the container when needed, rather than receiving it as a constructor parameter. This avoids circular dependencies in the DI system.

2. **Enhanced Field Access**: Updated the FieldAccessHandler to use the VariableReferenceResolverClient when available, significantly improving field access capabilities including:
   - Proper handling of array indices
   - Nested object property access
   - Type-aware formatting

3. **Robust Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling with graceful fallbacks when:
   - The client factory can't be resolved due to circular dependencies
   - Field access operations fail
   - Resolution operations encounter errors

4. **Context-Aware Formatting**: Implemented context-aware string formatting that preserves the surrounding text context when variables are resolved.

5. **Lazy Loading Pattern**: The resolver client is only created when actually needed, improving performance and reducing unnecessary dependencies.

6. **Comprehensive Tests**: Added new tests specifically for the direct container resolution pattern, verifying that:
   - The system attempts to use the client when available
   - The system gracefully falls back when the client is unavailable
   - The overall functionality is maintained regardless of client availability

## Areas Changed

- `services/pipeline/OutputService/OutputService.ts`: Updated to use direct container resolution
- `services/pipeline/OutputService/OutputService.test.ts`: Added tests for field access
- `tests/direct-container-resolution.test.ts`: Added dedicated tests for the direct container resolution pattern

## Implementation Approach

After evaluating various approaches to handle the circular dependency issue, we determined that direct container resolution with lazy loading is the most appropriate solution because:

1. It aligns with our DI architecture's Client Factory Pattern
2. It provides better performance by only resolving dependencies when needed
3. It maintains backward compatibility
4. It provides robust fallbacks for error cases
5. It's more maintainable than other solutions like the service mediator

## Test Coverage

The implementation includes tests for:
- Field access with direct container resolution
- Error handling when resolution fails
- Graceful degradation with appropriate fallbacks
- Formatting consistency

All existing tests continue to pass, ensuring backward compatibility.

## Next Steps

With this PR merged, we can proceed to Phase 5: Central Syntax Integration and API Cleanup, which will remove the workarounds in the API layer since they're no longer needed with the enhanced field access capabilities.
