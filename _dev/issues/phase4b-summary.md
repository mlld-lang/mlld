# Phase 4B Summary: Variable-based Embed Transformation Fix

## Issue Investigation

We've conducted a thorough investigation of the variable-based embed transformation issue in Phase 4B. The issue involves embed directives that use variable references with field access (e.g., `@embed {{role.architect}}`) not being properly replaced with their resolved values in transformation mode.

## Key Findings

1. **Root Cause Identification**: The root cause is that while variable references get resolved correctly during directive execution, the transformation system doesn't properly handle the variable reference text that appears in the replacement node. The variable text isn't resolved in the transformation stage, causing the final output to still contain the original variable reference.

2. **Pipeline Analysis**: We traced the entire pipeline from directive parsing through execution and output generation. The issue occurs because:
   - EmbedDirectiveHandler creates a TextNode replacement with the variable reference text
   - The state service correctly registers this transformation
   - But OutputService doesn't recognize or resolve the variable reference in the transformation

3. **Test Workarounds**: We identified temporary workarounds in the existing tests that bypass the issue by using mock results.

## Implementation Plan

We've created a detailed implementation plan in `_dev/issues/active/phase4b-implementation-plan.md` that includes:

1. **Fix Approach**: Add special handling in OutputService.nodeToMarkdown to directly resolve variable references for embed directives in transformation mode.

2. **Code Implementation**: A complete solution that:
   - Detects variable-based embed directives in transformation mode
   - Extracts variable names and field paths
   - Resolves variables from state service
   - Processes field access as needed
   - Properly handles different data types
   - Returns resolved values directly

3. **Testing Strategy**: 
   - Update existing tests by removing workarounds
   - Create additional tests for edge cases and complex field access

## Test Implementation

We've created a test file `tests/embed-variable-transform-fix.test.ts` that demonstrates:

1. The current issue with variable-based embed transformations
2. Our proposed solution with a complete implementation approach
3. Examples of different field access patterns that need to be supported

## Next Steps

The next steps for completing Phase 4B are:

1. Implement the fix in the `OutputService.nodeToMarkdown` method
2. Remove temporary workarounds from existing tests
3. Add comprehensive test coverage for all variable embed cases
4. Document the fix in the codebase

These changes will allow variable-based embed directives to work correctly in transformation mode without requiring special case handling in the tests.
