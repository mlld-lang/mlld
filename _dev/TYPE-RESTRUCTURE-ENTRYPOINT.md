# Type Restructure Project: Entrypoint

## 🎯 Project Goal
Unify AST and runtime types into a single coherent type system, eliminating artificial separation between parsing and execution types.

## 📍 Current Status
**Phase 5.5: Migration Verification Audit** - NEXT
We discovered that services marked as "completed" may not meet all migration criteria. A comprehensive audit is needed before continuing.

## 📄 Primary Document
**➡️ SEE `TYPE-RESTRUCTURE.md` FOR FULL DETAILS**

This entrypoint provides quick reference. The main plan document contains:
- Detailed current status
- Complete migration requirements
- Step-by-step implementation plan
- New Step 5.5 verification audit
- Timeline and milestones

## 🚨 Critical Discovery
Many services marked as "completed" still have:
- Old type imports from `@core/syntax/types`
- Incorrect AST structure usage (`node.directive.*`)
- Test files with wrong mock structures
- Supporting utilities not fully migrated

## 🔧 Immediate Next Steps

### Step 5.5: Migration Verification Audit (NEW)
Audit all "completed" services:
1. StateService
2. InterpreterService  
3. All 7 Directive Handlers
4. ParserService

**📊 Track progress in `MIGRATION-AUDIT-TRACKER.md`**
See `TYPE-RESTRUCTURE.md` for detailed audit checklist.
