# Type Restructure Project: Entrypoint

## 🎯 Project Goal
Unify AST and runtime types into a single coherent type system, eliminating artificial separation between parsing and execution types.

## 📍 Current Status
**Phase 5e: Test File Migration & Final Cleanup** - IN PROGRESS
Week 5 is nearly complete! OutputService, PathService and ParserService fully migrated. Only minor issues remain.

## 📄 Primary Document
**➡️ SEE `TYPE-RESTRUCTURE.md` FOR FULL DETAILS**

This entrypoint provides quick reference. The main plan document contains:
- Detailed current status
- Complete migration requirements
- Step-by-step implementation plan
- Timeline and milestones

## 🎉 Progress Summary
- **Core Services**: All main service files migrated to new AST types ✅
- **Directive Handlers**: All 7 handlers now use correct imports ✅
- **Import Issues**: 10/11 services fixed (only 1 file remains)
- **AST Structure**: All `node.directive.*` usage fixed ✅
- **Fully Migrated**: OutputService, PathService, ParserService ✅

## 🔧 Immediate Next Steps

### Step 5e: Fix Remaining Test File Issues
1. Update `services/resolution/ValidationService/validators/FuzzyMatchingValidator.ts` imports
2. Migrate remaining test files to use fixtures where appropriate
3. Prepare for Step 6: Final removal of legacy types folder

## 🛠️ Working Commands

```bash
# Building
npm run build

# Testing
npm test services/pipeline/OutputService     # Test OutputService
npm test services/fs/PathService             # Test PathService

# AST Tools  
npm run ast:process-all                      # Generate fixtures/snapshots
npm run ast:validate                         # Validate generated types

# Checking Migration Status
grep -r '@core/syntax/types' services/       # Find remaining old imports
```

## ✅ Completed Milestones

- **✅ Step 1-4b**: Type definitions, AST union, ParserService transformation
- **✅ Step 5a-c**: Core service migrations (State, Interpreter, Handlers)
- **✅ Step 5.5**: Full migration verification audit (found & fixed critical issues)
- **✅ Step 5d (Partial)**: OutputService, PathService and ParserService fully migrated

## 🎬 Getting Started in New Session

1. Read this entrypoint for the quick overview
2. Check `TYPE-RESTRUCTURE.md` for detailed current status
3. Fix remaining issues in Step 5e (validation service imports)
4. Prepare for Step 6: Removal of legacy types
