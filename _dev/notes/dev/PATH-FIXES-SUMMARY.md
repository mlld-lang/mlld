# Path Validation Fixes Summary

## Completed Fixes

1. **PathService.tmp.test.ts Tests**
   - Fixed tests that were failing due to mismatched error message expectations
   - Updated tests to expect the correct error messages about "paths with segments must start with $. or $~"
   - Ensured location information is properly included in errors

2. **API Integration Tests**
   - Fixed path validation tests by updating error message expectations
   - Changed tests to expect parser error messages instead of PathService error messages
   - Updated tests for raw absolute paths and paths with dot segments to use consistent error messages

3. **Error Message Standardization**
   - Fixed inconsistent error messages between path validators 
   - Aligned error messages between the parser and PathService
   - Ensured proper location information is included in path validation errors

4. **Path Handling Improvements**
   - Fixed handling of special path variables ($PROJECTPATH, $HOMEPATH, $., $~)
   - Ensured proper validation of path formats
   - Improved error messages to be more descriptive and helpful

## Remaining Issues

1. **Complex Multi-file Projects**
   - Tests for complex multi-file projects with imports are still failing
   - Need to address path-related errors in these integration tests

2. **Variable Resolution**
   - TextVar and DataVar resolution still needs work
   - Variable interpolation tests are failing

3. **Import Handling**
   - Tests for import handling are failing with path validation errors
   - Circular import detection needs to be fixed to check for circularity before path validation fails

4. **Command Execution**
   - Tests for @run directives and command execution need to be fixed
   - Define directive handler tests are failing

## Next Steps

1. Continue with AST integration work to ensure all services properly use the AST
2. Fix the variable resolution system to handle all variable types consistently
3. Update directive validators and handlers to work with structured paths
4. Address remaining integration test failures

This work has stabilized the path validation system by ensuring consistent error messages and proper validation of paths. The PathService tests and basic API integration tests for path validation are now passing, which provides a solid foundation for addressing the more complex issues remaining in the system.
