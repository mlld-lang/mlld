# Integration Test Fix Analysis

After examining the API integration tests in `api/integration.test.ts` and relevant code, I've found that the main issue is with how the directives are being structured in the AST.

## Core Issues

1. **Path Directive Structure**: The error suggests the AST node isn't structured correctly. The validator expects a structured node with `identifier` and `value` properties.

2. **AST Parsing**: The Meld parser isn't correctly creating AST nodes with the expected structure for the directives in the test file.

## Potential Solutions

1. **Fix the test content**: Make sure all directive syntax in the test file follows the exact pattern expected by the parser.

2. **Debug the AST generation**: Add logging to see what AST structure is being generated from the test content.

## Test Case Analysis

The test case content is:

```meld
@path docs = "$PROJECTPATH/docs"
@text docPath = "Docs are at ${docs}"
${docPath}
```

This structure should be valid according to the documentation and examples. The issue could be with:

1. Spaces around the equals sign
2. The format of the quoted string 
3. The AST generation for path directives

## Recommended Approach

1. Add a simple passing test case with a path directive
2. Compare the AST structure of the passing case with the failing case
3. Fix the test content to match the expected structure
