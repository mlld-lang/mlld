=== YOUR TASK =================

Choose 1-3 of the most fundamental problem to prioritize addressing.

For each chosen problem, please analyze the issue, along with the code and failing test associated.

On a scale of 100, assess your confidence in identifying the root cause and a solution.

If you are highly confident, provide the analysis, the root cause, and the solutions. Be explicit about the atomic changes to the code needed to fix the issue.

If you are below 80% confident, provide a recommended strategy and concrete steps for gathering futher evidence and analysis in order to increase your confidence.

BE DECISIVE AND EXPLICIT. DO NOT BE HANDWAVY OR HALLUCINATE.
