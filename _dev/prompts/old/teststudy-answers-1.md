Confidence Level: 90%

Analysis & Evidence:  
From the details provided in the “Issue Details” section, the most likely cause of the failing test is that the state tracking service does not get properly updated when the file path changes. Evidence for this appears in two places:

1) setCurrentFilePath method:  
   - The code sets the new path but does not re-register or update the tracking service.  
   - The subsequent debug session tries to retrieve the state snapshot based on the new file path but fails because the tracking service is never notified that the associated state has changed or should be re-registered.

2) updateState method:  
   - This method updates state fields but never calls the tracking service registerState method with the latest state ID and file path.  
   - Therefore, even though the in-memory state ID might be updated, the tracking service does not have correct metadata to serve the debugger’s snapshot request.

Recommended Solution:  
Decide whether changes to the file path signify a truly “new” state or an update to an existing state. Then ensure that either (1) setCurrentFilePath, or (2) updateState (or both) notify the tracking service with updated state metadata. Below is a minimal example of the “atomic changes” that would likely resolve the problem. One relatively simple fix is to register (or update) the state each time its file path is changed.

Atomic Changes Example (Option 1: Register in setCurrentFilePath):

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[StateService.ts]

public setCurrentFilePath(path: string): void {
  this.checkMutable();
  this.updateState({ filePath: path }, 'setCurrentFilePath');
  
  // New or updated code:
  if (this.trackingService && this.currentState?.stateId) {
    this.trackingService.registerState({
      id: this.currentState.stateId,
      source: 'filePathChange',
      filePath: path,
      transformationEnabled: this._transformationEnabled
    });
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Atomic Changes Example (Option 2: Update in updateState so that any change re-registers):

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[StateService.ts]

private updateState(updates: Partial<StateNode>, source: string): void {
  this.currentState = this.stateFactory.updateState(this.currentState, updates);

  // New or updated code:
  if (this.trackingService && this.currentState?.stateId) {
    this.trackingService.registerState({
      id: this.currentState.stateId,
      source,
      filePath: this.currentState.filePath,
      transformationEnabled: this._transformationEnabled
    });
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Either approach (or both) will ensure that immediately after the state’s file path is changed, the tracking metadata is consistent. Once that happens, the StateDebuggerService should be able to retrieve the updated state snapshot successfully during the test.

Additional Steps:  
1. Confirm whether file path changes should create an entirely new state entry or simply update the existing metadata in the tracking service. This depends on how the application domain defines state “identity.”  
2. Add a dedicated test that writes two files to the same path and verifies that the debugger, tracking, and snapshot retrieval still behave correctly after the second file is written.  
3. Document the lifecycle rules so that future maintainers understand when re-registration is expected.  
4. Consider adding a state validation or check in the DebuggerService that logs a more descriptive error when the state ID fails to map to a known state.  

Why 90% Confidence?  
The available diagnostic information and code patterns strongly suggest that incomplete coordination with the tracking service is the root cause. Although this approach should fix the immediate test failures, there could be corner cases related to concurrency or other services that rely on the file path for distinct identity. Implementing more thorough end-to-end tests and checking logs from both StateDebuggerService and StateTrackingService after changes would raise confidence closer to 100%.
