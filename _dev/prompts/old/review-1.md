You are an expert in building reliable and maintainable DSL systems, particularly in structuring state interpreters.

You are passionate about SOLID architecture, taking methodical approaches, and making incremental and testable changes.

You have created a thoughtfully structured plan for addressing some complex issues we have encountered. We are now asking for your help preparing a detailed plan which is written in order to maximize success based on it being carried out by an LLM developer.

However we're at a point where we need some advice.

I am going to provide you with some context:

- Architecture documentation (slightly outdated)
- Test setup
- The plan you provided for strategically approaching resolving issues related to generating the final build output

Then, below that, I'm going to provide the audit work completed so far.

\======= CONTEXT

\=== ARCHITECTURE

# Meld Architecture

## INTRODUCTION

Meld is a specialized, directive-based scripting language designed for embedding small "@directives" inside an otherwise plain text (e.g., Markdown-like) document. The code in this repository implements:

• Meld grammar rules and token types (e.g., text directives, path directives, data directives).
• The parsing layer that converts Meld content into an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).
• A directive interpretation layer that processes these AST nodes and manipulates internal "states" to store variables and more.
• A resolution layer to handle variable references, path expansions, data manipulations, etc.
• Testing utilities and an in-memory FS (memfs) to simulate filesystems for thorough testing.

The main idea:
1. Meld code is parsed to an AST.
2. Each directive node is validated and interpreted, updating a shared "state" (variables, data structures, commands, etc.).
3. Optional transformations (e.g., output formatting) generate final representations (Markdown, LLM-friendly XML, etc.).

Below is an overview of the directory and service-level architecture, referencing code from this codebase.

Key subfolders:
• services/: Each service is a self-contained module with its implementation, interface, tests, and any service-specific utilities
• core/: Central types, errors, and utilities used throughout the codebase
• tests/utils/: Test infrastructure including the memfs implementation, fixture management, and test helpers
• api/: High-level public API for using Meld programmatically
• cli/: Command line interface for Meld

## CORE LIBRARIES & THEIR ROLE

### meld-ast
   • parse(content: string): MeldNode[]
   • Basic parsing that identifies directives vs. text nodes.
   • Produces an AST which other services manipulate.

### llmxml
   • Converts content to an LLM-friendly XML format or can parse partially.
   • OutputService may call it if user requests "llm" format.

### meld-spec
   • Contains interface definitions for MeldNode, DirectiveNode, TextNode, etc.
   • Contains directive kind enumerations.

## HIGH-LEVEL FLOW

Below is a simplified flow of how Meld content is processed:

   ┌─────────────────────────────┐
   │   Meld Source Document      │
   └─────────────────────────────┘
                │
                ▼
   ┌─────────────────────────────┐
   │ ParserService.parse(...)    │
   │   → uses meld-ast to parse  │
   └─────────────────────────────┘
                │ AST (MeldNode[])
                ▼
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ InterpreterService.interpret(nodes, options)    │
   │   → For each node, pass to DirectiveService     │
   │   → Handles node transformations                │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                │
                ▼
   ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ DirectiveService                         │
   │   → Routes to correct directive handler  │
   │   → Handlers can provide replacements    │
   └──────────────────────────────────────────┘
                │
                ▼
   ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ StateService + ResolutionService + Others     │
   │   → Stores variables and transformed nodes    │
   │   → Path expansions, data lookups, etc.       │
   └───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                │
                ▼
   ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ OutputService                            │
   │   → Uses transformed nodes for output    │
   │   → Generates clean, directive-free      │
   │     markdown, LLM XML, or other formats  │
   └──────────────────────────────────────────┘

## MAJOR SERVICES (OVERVIEW)

Below are the key "services" in the codebase. Each follows the single responsibility principle:

### CLIService
   - Provides command-line interface for running Meld
   - Handles file watching and reprocessing
   - Manages format selection and output options
   - Routes to appropriate services based on CLI flags

### ParserService
   - Wraps the meld-ast parse(content) function
   - Adds location information with file paths (parseWithLocations)
   - Produces an array of MeldNode objects

### DirectiveService
   - Routes directives to the correct directive handler
   - Validates directives using ValidationService
   - Calls ResolutionService for variable resolution
   - Updates StateService with directive execution results
   - Supports node transformation through DirectiveResult interface
   - Handlers can provide replacement nodes for transformed output

### InterpreterService
   - Orchestrates the main interpret(nodes) pipeline
   - For each AST node:
       a) If it's text, store it or pass it along
       b) If it's a directive:
          - Calls DirectiveService for processing
          - Handles node transformations if provided
          - Updates state with transformed nodes
   - Maintains the top-level process flow
   - Supports transformation mode through feature flags

### StateService
   - Stores variables in maps:
       • textVars (for @text)
       • dataVars (for @data)
       • pathVars (for @path)
       • commands (for @define)
   - Tracks both original and transformed MeldNodes
   - Provides transformation capabilities for directive processing
   - Maintains transformation state during cloning
   - Provides child states for nested imports
   - Supports immutability toggles

### ResolutionService
   - Handles all variable interpolation:
       • Text variables ("${var}")
       • Data references ("#{data.field}")
       • Path expansions ("$HOMEPATH/path")
       • Command references
   - Context-aware resolution
   - Circular reference detection
   - Sub-fragment parsing support

### CircularityService
   - Prevents infinite import loops
   - Detects circular variable references
   - Maintains dependency graphs

### PathService
   - Validates and normalizes paths
   - Enforces path security constraints
   - Handles path joining and manipulation
   - Supports test mode for path operations

### ValidationService
   - Validates directive syntax and constraints
   - Provides extensible validator registration
   - Throws MeldDirectiveError on validation failures
   - Tracks available directive kinds

###  FileSystemService
    - Abstracts file operations (read, write)
    - Supports both real and test filesystems
    - Handles path resolution and validation

### OutputService
    - Converts final AST and state to desired format
    - Uses transformed nodes when available
    - Supports markdown and LLM XML output
    - Integrates with llmxml for LLM-friendly formatting
    - Handles format-specific transformations
    - Provides clean output without directive definitions

## TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE

All tests are heavily reliant on a memory-based filesystem (memfs) for isolation and speed. The major testing utilities include:

### MemfsTestFileSystem
   – Thin wrapper around memfs
   – Offers readFile, writeFile, mkdir, etc. with in-memory data
   – Provides an ephemeral environment for all test IO

### TestContext
   – Central test harness that creates a new MemfsTestFileSystem
   – Provides references to all major services (ParserService, DirectiveService, etc.)
   – Allows writing files, snapshotting the FS, and comparing

### TestSnapshot
   – Takes "snapshots" of the current Memfs FS, storing a Map<filePath, content>
   – Compares snapshots to detect added/removed/modified files

### ProjectBuilder
   – Creates mock "projects" in the in-memory FS from JSON structure
   – Useful for complex, multi-file tests or large fixture-based testing

### Node Factories
   – Provides helper functions for creating AST nodes in tests
   – Supports creating directive, text, and code fence nodes
   – Includes location utilities for source mapping

Testing Organization:
• tests/utils/: Core test infrastructure (MemFS, snapshots, contexts)
• tests/mocks/: Minimal mocks and test doubles
• tests/fixtures/: JSON-based test data
• tests/services/: Service-specific integration tests

Testing Approach:
• Each test uses a fresh TestContext or recreates MemfsTestFileSystem
• Direct imports from core packages (meld-ast, meld-spec) for types
• Factory functions for creating test nodes and data
• Snapshots for tracking filesystem changes

## SERVICE RELATIONSHIPS

                        | Clean Output Gen   |
                        +---------------------+

Key relationships:
• InterpreterService orchestrates directive processing and transformation pipeline
• DirectiveService processes directives and manages node transformations
• Handlers can provide replacement nodes for transformed output
• StateService maintains both original and transformed node states
• OutputService uses transformed nodes for clean output generation

## EXAMPLE USAGE SCENARIO

1) Input: A .meld file with lines like:
   @text greeting = "Hello"
   @data config = { "value": 123 }
   @import [ path = "other.meld" ]

2) We load the file from disk.
3) ParserService → parse the content → AST.
4) InterpreterService → interpret(AST).
   a) For each directive, DirectiveService → validation → resolution → update StateService.
   b) If an import is encountered, CircularityService ensures no infinite loops.
5) Once done, the final StateService has textVars.greeting = "Hello", dataVars.config = { value: 123 }, etc.
6) OutputService can generate the final text or an LLM-XML representation.

## ERROR HANDLING

• MeldDirectiveError thrown if a directive fails validation or interpretation.
• MeldParseError if the parser cannot parse content.
• PathValidationError for invalid paths.
• ResolutionError for variable resolution issues.
• MeldError as a base class for other specialized errors.

These errors typically bubble up to the caller or test.

## CONCLUSION

This codebase implements the entire Meld language pipeline:
• Parsing Meld documents into an AST.
• Validating & interpreting directives.
• Storing data in a hierarchical state.
• Resolving references (text, data, paths, commands).
• (Optionally) generating final formatted output.

Plus, it has a robust test environment with an in-memory FS, snapshots, and a test harness (TestContext) for integration and unit tests. Everything is layered to keep parsing, state management, directive logic, and resolution separate, adhering to SOLID design principles.

The ASCII diagrams, modules, and file references in this overview represent the CURRENT code as it is: multiple specialized services collaborating to parse and interpret Meld scripts thoroughly—test coverage is facilitated by the in-memory mocking and snapshot-based verification.

\=== TEST SETUP

# Testing in Meld

This document outlines the testing infrastructure and best practices for the Meld codebase. It serves as a practical guide for writing and maintaining tests.

## Directory Structure

Tests are organized following these conventions:

```
project-root/
├─ tests/                    # Test infrastructure and shared resources
│  ├─ utils/                # Test utilities and factories
│  ├─ mocks/                # Shared mock implementations
│  ├─ fixtures/             # Test fixture data
│  └─ setup.ts             # Global test setup
└─ services/               # Service implementations with co-located tests
   └─ ServiceName/
      ├─ ServiceName.test.ts           # Unit tests
      ├─ ServiceName.integration.test.ts # Integration tests
      └─ handlers/
         └─ HandlerName.test.ts        # Handler-specific tests
```

## Test Infrastructure

### Core Testing Utilities

1. **TestContext**
   - Central test harness providing access to all test utilities
   - Manages test state and cleanup
   - Available globally in tests as `testContext`

2. **Test Factories**
   - Located in `tests/utils/testFactories.ts`
   - Provides helper functions for creating test nodes and mocks
   - Ensures consistent test data creation

Example usage:
```typescript
import {
  createDefineDirective,
  createLocation,
  createMockStateService
} from '@tests/utils/testFactories';

const node = createDefineDirective(
  'greet',
  'echo "Hello"',
  [],
  createLocation(1, 1, 1, 20)
);

const mockState = createMockStateService();
```

### Mock Services

The test factories provide mock implementations for all core services:

```typescript
const mockServices = {
  stateService: createMockStateService(),
  validationService: createMockValidationService(),
  resolutionService: createMockResolutionService(),
  fileSystemService: createMockFileSystemService(),
  // ... etc
};
```

Each mock service implements the corresponding interface and provides sensible defaults.

## Writing Tests

### Service Tests

Service tests should follow this structure:

```typescript
describe('ServiceName', () => {
  let service: ServiceName;
  let dependencies: {
    stateService: IStateService;
    // ... other dependencies
  };

  beforeEach(() => {
    dependencies = {
      stateService: createMockStateService(),
      // ... initialize other dependencies
    };
    service = new ServiceName(dependencies);
  });

  describe('core functionality', () => {
    it('should handle basic operations', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const input = // ... test input

      // Act
      const result = await service.operation(input);

      // Assert
      expect(result).toBeDefined();
      expect(dependencies.stateService.someMethod)
        .toHaveBeenCalledWith(expectedArgs);
    });
  });

  describe('error handling', () => {
    it('should handle errors appropriately', async () => {
      // ... error test cases
    });
  });
});
```

### Directive Handler Tests

Directive handler tests should cover:

1. Value Processing
   - Basic value handling
   - Parameter processing
   - Edge cases

2. Validation Integration
   - Integration with ValidationService
   - Validation error handling

3. State Management
   - State updates
   - Command/variable storage
   - Original and transformed node states
   - Node replacement handling

4. Transformation Behavior
   - Node replacement generation
   - Transformation state preservation
   - Clean output verification

5. Error Handling
   - Validation errors
   - Resolution errors
   - State errors
   - Transformation errors

Example structure:
```typescript
describe('HandlerName', () => {
  let handler: HandlerName;
  let dependencies: {
    validationService: IValidationService;
    stateService: IStateService;
    resolutionService: IResolutionService;
  };

  beforeEach(() => {
    dependencies = {
      validationService: createMockValidationService(),
      stateService: createMockStateService(),
      resolutionService: createMockResolutionService()
    };
    handler = new HandlerName(dependencies);
  });

  describe('value processing', () => {
    // Value processing tests
  });

  describe('validation', () => {
    // Validation tests
  });

  describe('state management', () => {
    // State management tests
  });

  describe('transformation', () => {
    it('should provide correct replacement nodes', async () => {
      const node = createDirectiveNode('test', { value: 'example' });
      const result = await handler.execute(node, context);

      expect(result.replacement).toBeDefined();
      expect(result.replacement.type).toBe('Text');
      expect(result.replacement.content).toBe('example');
    });

    it('should preserve location in transformed nodes', async () => {
      const node = createDirectiveNode('test', { value: 'example' });
      const result = await handler.execute(node, context);

      expect(result.replacement.location).toEqual(node.location);
    });
  });

  describe('error handling', () => {
    // Error handling tests
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests

Integration tests should focus on real-world scenarios and service interactions:

```typescript
describe('Service Integration', () => {
  let services: {
    directiveService: DirectiveService;
    stateService: StateService;
    // ... other real service instances
  };

  beforeEach(() => {
    services = {
      directiveService: new DirectiveService(),
      stateService: new StateService(),
      // ... initialize other services
    };

    // Initialize service relationships
    services.directiveService.initialize(
      services.validationService,
      services.stateService,
      services.resolutionService
    );
  });

  it('should process complex scenarios', async () => {
    // Test end-to-end flows
  });

  it('should generate clean output without directives', async () => {
    const input = `
      @text greeting = "Hello"
      @run [echo ${greeting}]
      Regular text
    `;

    const result = await processDocument(input);

    expect(result).not.toContain('@text');
    expect(result).not.toContain('@run');
    expect(result).toContain('Hello');
    expect(result).toContain('Regular text');
  });

  it('should maintain both original and transformed states', async () => {
    const state = await processDocument(input);

    expect(state.getOriginalNodes()).toHaveLength(3);
    expect(state.getTransformedNodes()).toHaveLength(2);
  });
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Test Organization**
   - Co-locate tests with implementation files
   - Use clear, descriptive test names
   - Group related tests using `describe` blocks
   - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

2. **Mock Usage**
   - Use the provided mock factories
   - Set up specific mock implementations in beforeEach
   - Clear all mocks between tests
   - Be explicit about mock expectations

3. **Error Testing**
   - Test both expected and unexpected errors
   - Verify error messages and types
   - Test error propagation
   - Include location information in errors

4. **Location Handling**
   - Always include location information in test nodes
   - Use `createLocation` helper for consistency
   - Test location propagation in errors
   - Verify location preservation in transformed nodes

5. **State Management**
   - Test state immutability
   - Verify state cloning
   - Test parent/child state relationships
   - Validate state updates
   - Test both original and transformed node states
   - Verify transformation state persistence

6. **Transformation Testing**
   - Test node replacement generation
   - Verify clean output formatting
   - Test transformation state inheritance
   - Validate directive removal in output
   - Test complex transformation scenarios

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test services/DirectiveService/handlers/definition/DefineDirectiveHandler.test.ts

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Test Coverage

The project maintains high test coverage through:
- Unit tests for all services and handlers
- Integration tests for service interactions
- Error case coverage
- Edge case testing

Coverage reports can be generated using:
```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Debugging Tests

1. Use the `debug` logger in tests:
```typescript
import { debug } from '@core/utils/logger';

it('should handle complex case', () => {
  debug('Test state:', someObject);
});
```

2. Use Node.js debugger:
   - Add `debugger` statement in test
   - Run `npm test -- --inspect-brk`
   - Connect Chrome DevTools

3. Use Vitest UI:
```bash
npm test -- --ui
```

\=== YOUR PLAN (VERY IMPORTANT CONTEXT)

Below is a clarified, evidence-driven plan for methodically resolving the transformation issues, state management bugs, and mismatches between real and mock services—all while preserving passing tests as we proceed. It incorporates the high-level advice of instrumenting each step, auditing our interfaces, and aligning mocks with real services. It is broken into phases to ensure incremental progress without regressions.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 0: CONTEXT & GOALS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Before making any changes, we must align on what we are trying to accomplish and how it fits into our existing Meld architecture and testing approach.

1. Context:
   • Meld interprets directive-based text into an AST, processes directives (possibly transforming or removing them), and generates output (Markdown, XML, etc.).
   • "StateService" manages variables, transformations, and can clone its internal state for nested or repeated directive processing.
   • "DirectiveService" and its handlers produce results that may replace directives in the final AST (transformation mode).
   • The "OutputService" consumes nodes: if in transformation mode, it should see only text/code nodes and never see directive definitions.
   • Mocks in tests sometimes omit partial implementations (like "clone()"), leading to runtime errors in integration or API tests.

2. Key Goals:
   1) Eliminate errors around missing or incorrect state methods (e.g. "currentState.clone is not a function").
   2) Ensure transformation mode consistently replaces directives with their processed output, so the final output shows "test output" instead of raw directives like "@run [echo test]."
   3) Maintain high test coverage and pass existing tests (unless a test's expectation is flatly incorrect).

3. High-Level Purpose:
   This plan ensures a stable approach to directive transformation—replacing directives with textual or code content—while retaining a well-defined "StateService" interface and consistent test mocks. By the end of these phases, "run" directives, "embed" directives, and others should yield correct transformed nodes, and all code paths (API, integration, unit) should rely on consistent service initializations.

4. Critical Dependencies:
   • Service Initialization Order:
     - Proper initialization sequence (as shown in cli/index.ts)
     - Handling of circular dependencies between services
     - Transformation mode initialization timing
   • State Management:
     - StateService clone operation must preserve transformation state
     - Child states must inherit transformation settings
     - State merging must handle transformed nodes correctly
   • Handler Flow:
     - Handlers must check transformation mode before replacing nodes
     - Node replacement must preserve source locations
     - Error handling must work in both modes
   • Test Infrastructure:
     - TestContext initialization must support both modes
     - Mock services must implement full interfaces
     - Integration tests must use consistent service setup

5. Key Architectural Decisions Required:
   1. Transformation Mode Scope:
      - Global vs per-directive setting
      - Inheritance rules for nested states
      - Default behavior and configuration
   2. Transformation Completeness:
      - All-or-nothing vs partial transformation support
      - Mixing transformed and untransformed content
      - Backward compatibility requirements
   3. Error Handling Strategy:
      - Location preservation in transformed nodes
      - Error reporting in transformation mode
      - Recovery options for partial failures

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 1: AUDIT & ALIGNMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Objective: Rigorously align our service interfaces, the real implementations, and our test mocks before modifying any production code paths for transformation. This prevents repeated "ping-pong" fixes later.

1. Interface & Implementation Audit (IStateService):
   • Compare the real "StateService" methods to "IStateService."
   • Confirm that "clone()", "getTransformedNodes,", "isTransformationEnabled," etc. are declared exactly in both.
   • Check that every method used in production code is actually typed in the interface.
   • If any method is missing or partially typed, update "IStateService" accordingly.

2. Mock Services Audit:
   • For each critical mock (especially the StateService mock), confirm it either implements all "IStateService" methods or explicitly extends a real instance.
   • In a single doc or table, list each method (clone, addNode, transformNode, etc.), whether it is implemented in the real code, and whether it is implemented in the mock.
   • Add missing methods to the mocks where needed.
   • Validate that the mock returns data types consistent with the real service (e.g. "clone" returns a new valid mock, not a plain object).

3. Test-by-Test Check for Partial Mocks:
   • In the failing API integration tests and OutputService transformation tests, examine exactly how "StateService" (or its mocks) is created.
   • If any tests pass in one file but fail in another, note differences in mock usage so we can unify them later.
   • Do not change any production code yet—only refine or unify the mock definitions if they are incomplete.

4. Deliverables & Exit Criteria:
   • A short "Interface vs. Implementation" mapping document (even a simple table).
   • Updated "IStateService" that matches real usage in code.
   • Updated StateService mock(s) ensuring "clone" and "transformation" methods are properly defined.
   • All existing tests should still pass—this step is purely aligning definitions without changing production logic.

Success Criteria:
• All service interfaces are fully documented
• Implementation gaps are identified
• Mock implementations are validated
• No production code changes
• All existing tests remain passing

Evidence Required:
• Interface analysis documentation
• Mock implementation audit
• Test coverage analysis
• Service interaction map

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 2: EVIDENCE COLLECTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Objective: Build small, targeted test suites to verify that the newly aligned real services and mocks behave as expected in isolation. This clarifies where transformation fails or where a "clone" method might be returning incomplete objects.

1. "StateService.clone.test.ts":
   • Create a minimal test file that:
     (a) Instantiates the real StateService.
     (b) Populates it with text/data variables, a small list of nodes, or a mock directive node.
     (c) Calls "clone()" and verifies each field (variables, commands, original nodes, transformed nodes) is copied properly.
   • Confirm any transformation flags are copied if they exist.
   • Confirm that the cloned state is not referencing the same arrays as the original.

2. "TransformationMode.test.ts" (Optional if not already present):
   • A minimal test that uses the real "DirectiveService," real or partial "RunDirectiveHandler," and real "StateService."
   • Creates a single directive node ("@run [echo test]") with transformation enabled.
   • Checks that after processing, "StateService.getTransformedNodes()" has replaced the directive node with the output ("test\n" or whatever is produced).
   • Confirms no directives remain in the "transformedNodes" array.

3. Basic Logging / Instrumentation:
   • In these mini tests, add a few console.logs or debug logs to confirm what "clone()" returns and that "transformedNodes" is updated.
   • This ensures our isolation environment lines up with real production expectations.

4. Deliverables & Exit Criteria:
   • Dedicated, passing isolation tests for "clone" and transformation.
   • Confidence that the real "StateService" does indeed replicate behavior we expect.
   • If these mini-tests fail, fix them before moving on.
   • Again, no major production code changes (besides possibly small fixes to "clone" if needed). All existing production tests should still pass.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 3: INSTRUMENT FAILING INTEGRATION TESTS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Objective: Now that we trust the "StateService" and mock setups, locate precisely where the failing large-scope tests (API integration, OutputService transformation) diverge from the proven mini-tests.

1. Identify All Failing Tests:
   • The user's context indicates 7 failing tests:
     (a) 4 in "api/api.test.ts" around "currentState.clone is not a function."
     (b) 3 in OutputService transformation mode.

2. Add Debug Logs:
   • For each failing test, inject logs that show:
     • The exact type of "currentState" or "state" object being passed around (e.g. use "console.log(state.constructor.name)").
     • The presence or absence of "clone()" in that object or whether transformation is enabled.
     • The final array in "state.getTransformedNodes()" if we are in transformation mode.
   • This yields evidence: does the test accidentally inject some partial object? Does "getTransformedNodes()" come back empty?

3. Compare with Passing Tests:
   • If there is a closely related passing test (e.g. a simpler run directive test in OutputService), do a side-by-side to see how it configures the test harness vs. the failing test:
     (a) Does the passing test set "enableTransformation(true)" but the failing test does not?
     (b) Does the passing test create a real "StateService" while the failing test uses a stub?

4. Deliverables & Exit Criteria:
   • A short log output or debug capture for each failing test.
   • A clear note explaining which object or method is missing or incorrectly set up.
   • No code changes beyond inserting logs and debugging statements. At this point, we want the raw evidence.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 4: RESOLVE MISMATCHES AND ENSURE PRODUCTION-LIKE SETUP
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Objective: Now that we see precisely which mocks or service initializations differ from production, we systematically fix them so the big tests pass.

1. Fix "StateService" Injection in Tests:
   • If logs show that "api/api.test.ts" uses a "fakeState" that lacks "clone," replace it with either (a) a proper mock that includes "clone()" or (b) the real "StateService" if we want a full integration test.
   • Ensure each test that needs transformation mode is actually enabling transformation the same way production code does (e.g. "context.state.enableTransformation(true)").

2. Confirm DirectiveService -> StateService Flow:
   • In the "api/api.test.ts," check that "DirectiveService" is truly returning a new state object that also has "clone()."
   • If a partial mock is returned, unify it (likely remove partial mocks for full integration tests, or fully implement them so they match production).

3. OutputService Node Flow:
   • For the 3 failing OutputService tests, confirm that by the time "OutputService.convert" is called, "state.getTransformedNodes()" actually has the directive replaced.
   • If not, check "RunDirectiveHandler.execute" or "EmbedDirectiveHandler.execute" calls to see if they store the replacement node.
   • Correct the logic or the test setup as needed. This might mean ensuring we call "interpreterService.interpret([...], { transformation: true })" in the test.

4. Deliverables & Exit Criteria:
   • All 7 failing tests now pass (unless a test's expectation is truly incorrect). If the test's logic contradicts real architecture decisions, correct the test description or remove it.
   • No directive definitions or raw commands appear in the final output for transformation-based tests.
   • Feature parity with the mini-tests from Phase 2.

By the end of this phase, the fundamental clones and transformation flows in integration tests will match what we already proved in isolation.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 5: DIRECTIVE & OUTPUT CONSISTENCY RULES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Objective: Confirm that the entire codebase has a unified rule on how directives should appear (or not appear) in output, plus handle any special edge cases (e.g., a directive intentionally kept).

1. Unify the Directive Transformation Rule:
   • Decide, once and for all, if seeing a "DirectiveNode" in transformation mode is a valid scenario or an error.
   • If it's always invalid, ensure each directive handler replaces itself with text/code.
   • If some directives are allowed, confirm which, under which conditions, and ensure all relevant handlers exhibit consistent logic.

2. Update Documentation & Comments:
   • In "docs/ARCHITECTURE.md" or a relevant doc, clarify that in transformation mode, all directive nodes are replaced by text/code nodes, or removed if they produce no user-visible output.
   • Document how test authors can expect "StateService" to store final, transformed nodes.

3. Adjust or Add Tests if Needed:
   • If we discover any contradictory test scenario (one expects a directive to remain, another demands it vanish), either unify the expectation or split them into two test modes with explicit rationales.
   • Add new coverage for corner cases:
     (a) A directive that has no output (like a pure definition).
     (b) A directive that partially modifies the text but remains.
     (c) Edge cases around error handling (e.g., directive fails to transform properly).

4. Deliverables & Exit Criteria:
   • A clear-coded "transformation contract" that every directive handler follows.
   • Documentation in the code (JSDoc or doc comments) plus test coverage verifying this rule.
   • No contradictions or confusion in the test suite about whether "@define," "@import," etc. should appear in final output.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 6: CLEANUP & LONG-TERM MAINTENANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Objective: With all tests passing and consistent transformation rules in place, remove any debugging artifacts, unify leftover flags, and ensure we have robust instructions for future maintainers.

1. Remove or Convert Debug Logs:
   • If you inserted "console.log" or "debugger" statements in integration tests, strip them out or convert them to a more permanent debugging facility (stop spamming test outputs).

2. Finalize Docs & Architecture Overviews:
   • Incorporate diagrams or bullet references in "docs/ARCHITECTURE.md," "docs/TESTS.md," or "services/StateService/README.md" explaining the transformation pipeline.
   • Summarize the "mini-tests" approach, so future devs can replicate it quickly when diagnosing new issues.

3. Ensure Ongoing Test Consistency:
   • Double-check that no new partial mocks slip in.
   • Possibly add a lint or code check that mocks must implement the entire "IStateService" if they claim to do so.

4. Deliverables & Exit Criteria:
   • A final, stable codebase with no transformation or state-management failures.
   • Thorough documentation for new devs to quickly see how we handle directive-to-text transformations.
   • All 484 tests passing consistently, plus the new mini-tests and any updated coverage.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SUMMARY OF HOW THIS IS INCREMENTAL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Phases 1–2 do not alter any core business logic; they simply align interfaces and confirm they function in isolation, ensuring no existing tests break.
• Phases 3–4 systematically address the failing integration tests by matching them to real-world usage (no partial mocks, correct transformation toggles). We expect to fix the 7 known failing tests here without breaking the other 400+ passing tests.
• Phases 5–6 unify directive transformation rules in all docs/tests, then clean up leftover logs or toggles. This final step ensures a fully coherent design that new team members can easily follow.

By following this plan in order—always focusing first on proven alignment before changing bigger test code—we avoid partial fixes that re-break existing functionality. This methodical approach uses evidence at each stage, verifying that "transformation mode" and "clone()" work as intended in isolation and in real integration flows.

\======= END CONTEXT

\======= AUDIT WORK COMPLETED

The following documents were created by LLMs working on the audit advised by the plan.

I'm concerned that they got a bit context drunk and I'm suspect of the accuracy of their information. We may need to take a different approach to completing the audit work.

## Audit Progress

### StateService (In Progress)

#### Mock Implementation Review
1. Multiple Mock Implementations Found:
   - `tests/mocks/state.ts`: Legacy `InterpreterState` class
   - `tests/utils/testFactories.ts`: Current `createMockStateService()`
   - `tests/utils/TestContext.ts`: Uses real `StateService` in test setup

2. Interface Alignment Status:
   - ✓ All interface methods present in `createMockStateService`
   - ✗ Legacy `InterpreterState` missing transformation methods
   - ⚠️ Mock implementations don't match real service behavior

3. Critical Gaps:
   - Transformation state inheritance not properly handled
   - Inconsistent state preservation in cloning
   - Child state creation doesn't match real implementation
   - State merging behavior differs between mocks and real service

4. Test Usage Patterns:
   - Some tests use legacy mock
   - Some tests use factory-created mock
   - Some tests use real service
   - No consistent pattern across test suite

#### Next Steps
1. Complete interface alignment audit
2. Document transformation state lifecycle
3. Verify mock behavior matches real implementation
4. Plan migration from legacy mock to current mock

## Notes

### StateService Audit Findings

1. Interface Definition (`IStateService.ts`):
   - ✅ Well-defined interface with clear method groupings
   - ✅ Explicit transformation methods marked as "(new)"
   - ✅ Complete method signatures for all operations

2. Implementation (`StateService.ts`):
   - Core State Management:
     - Uses immutable `StateNode` pattern
     - Maintains state through `StateFactory`
     - All state updates go through `updateState()`

   - Transformation Implementation:
     - Private `_transformationEnabled` flag
     - Dual node arrays: `nodes` and `transformedNodes`
     - `transformedNodes` initialized as copy of `nodes` when enabled
     - Transformation operations properly check mutability

   - Inconsistent behavior with real service
   - Missing transformation state handling
   - State inheritance not properly implemented

4. Test Context Concerns:
   - Mixed usage of real and mock services
   - Inconsistent transformation state defaults
   - Potential source of test failures

## Next Steps

1. Review each interface file
2. Compare with implementation
3. Verify mock implementations
4. Document any gaps or misalignments
5. Propose fixes for identified issues

## Notes

### StateService Audit Findings

1. Interface Definition (`IStateService.ts`):
   - ✅ Well-defined interface with clear method groupings
   - ✅ Explicit transformation methods marked as "(new)"
   - ✅ Complete method signatures for all operations

2. Implementation (`StateService.ts`):
   - Core State Management:
     - Uses immutable `StateNode` pattern
     - Maintains state through `StateFactory`
     - All state updates go through `updateState()`

   - Transformation Implementation:
     - Private `_transformationEnabled` flag
     - Dual node arrays: `nodes` and `transformedNodes`
     - `transformedNodes` initialized as copy of `nodes` when enabled
     - Transformation operations properly check mutability

3. State Factory (`StateFactory.ts`):
   - Handles immutable state updates
   - Properly copies transformed nodes in:
     - `createState`
     - `createChildState`
     - `mergeStates`
     - `updateState`

4. Critical Findings:
   a) Clone Implementation:
      ```typescript
      clone(): IStateService {
        const cloned = new StateService();
        cloned.currentState = this.stateFactory.createState({...});
        cloned.updateState({
          // ... other state ...
          transformedNodes: this.currentState.transformedNodes ?
            [...this.currentState.transformedNodes] : undefined,
        }, 'clone');
        cloned._transformationEnabled = this._transformationEnabled;
        return cloned;
      }
      ```
      - ✅ Creates new service instance
      - ✅ Copies transformation flag
      - ✅ Copies transformed nodes if they exist
      - ✅ Uses factory for state creation
      - ❓ Potential issue: Does `createState` properly handle all parent state?

   b) Transformation State Handling:
      - Transformation state is tracked in multiple places:
        1. Service level: `_transformationEnabled` flag
        2. State level: `transformedNodes` array
        3. Factory level: Copied during state operations
      - This complexity could lead to inconsistencies

5. Test Coverage (`StateService.transformation.test.ts`):
   - ✅ Tests default transformation state
   - ✅ Tests node transformation
   - ✅ Tests state preservation in cloning
   - ✅ Tests immutability with transformations
   - ❓ Missing: Tests for complex state inheritance scenarios

6. Potential Issues:
   a) State Inheritance:
      - Complex interaction between parent/child states and transformation
      - Need to verify transformation state is properly inherited

   b) State Merging:
      - `mergeStates` handles transformed nodes, but logic might need review
      - Child transformed nodes take precedence without clear documentation why

   c) Mock Implementation:
      - Need to verify mock service properly implements all this complexity
      - Particularly around state inheritance and transformation

Next Steps for StateService Audit:
1. Review mock implementation in `testFactories.ts`
2. Verify state inheritance behavior in failing tests
3. Document complete transformation state lifecycle
4. Review all callers of `clone()` to verify proper usage

(This section will be updated as we proceed with the audit)

# StateService Audit Notes

## Core Responsibilities (from ARCHITECTURE.md and PIPELINE.md)
1. Maintain both original and transformed node trees
2. Handle state inheritance correctly
3. Support immutable state operations
4. Manage transformation state through cloning/merging

## Critical State Operations

### 1. Node Management
- Original nodes array
- Transformed nodes array (optional)
- Node addition/removal
- Content appending
- Transformation tracking

### 2. State Lifecycle
```typescript
// Key operations that must preserve transformation state:
createChildState()
mergeChildState()
clone()
```

### 3. Transformation State
- Service level: `_transformationEnabled` flag
- State level: `transformedNodes` array
- Factory level: Transformation state copying

## StateFactory Implementation Findings

### 1. State Creation
```typescript
createState(options?: StateNodeOptions): StateNode {
  // Creates new maps from parent if available
  const state: StateNode = {
    variables: {
      text: new Map(options?.parentState?.variables.text ?? []),
      data: new Map(options?.parentState?.variables.data ?? []),
      path: new Map(options?.parentState?.variables.path ?? [])
    },
    commands: new Map(options?.parentState?.commands ?? []),
    imports: new Set(options?.parentState?.imports ?? []),
    nodes: [...(options?.parentState?.nodes ?? [])],
    transformedNodes: options?.parentState?.transformedNodes ?
      [...options.parentState.transformedNodes] : undefined,
    filePath: options?.filePath ?? options?.parentState?.filePath,
    parentState: options?.parentState
  };
  // ...
}
```

Key Observations:
- All maps and collections are properly cloned
- Parent state is preserved in new state
- Transformation nodes are conditionally copied
- Immutability is maintained through new Map/Set creation

### 2. State Merging
```typescript
mergeStates(parent: StateNode, child: StateNode): StateNode {
  // Creates new maps with parent as base
  const text = new Map(parent.variables.text);
  const data = new Map(parent.variables.data);
  const path = new Map(parent.variables.path);
  const commands = new Map(parent.commands);

  // Child values override parent values
  for (const [key, value] of child.variables.text) {
    text.set(key, value);
  }
  // ... similar for other maps ...

  // Nodes are appended, not merged
  nodes: [...parent.nodes, ...child.nodes],

  // Transformed nodes from child take precedence
  transformedNodes: child.transformedNodes !== undefined ?
    [...child.transformedNodes] :
    parent.transformedNodes !== undefined ?
      [...parent.transformedNodes] : undefined,
}
```

Key Observations:
- Child state takes precedence over parent
- Collections are properly cloned
- Nodes are appended rather than replaced
- Transformed nodes follow child-first precedence

## Potential Issues Found

### 1. State Inheritance Chain
Verified Behavior:
- Parent state is properly referenced in child states
- Maps and collections are properly cloned during inheritance
- Child states can override parent values
- Transformation state is preserved in child creation

Potential Issues:
- No validation of parent/child relationship consistency
- No checks for circular parent references
- Transformation flags not explicitly copied in child creation
- No validation of transformed nodes matching original nodes

### 2. State Cloning Depth
Current clone implementation has proper deep cloning:
- Creates new state without parent reference
- Properly clones all collections
- Preserves transformation state
- Copies service-level flags

### 3. State Factory Operations
Verified operations:
```typescript
createState() - ✓ Proper cloning, parent handling
createChildState() - ✓ Inherits parent state correctly
mergeStates() - ✓ Child precedence, proper cloning
updateState() - ✓ Immutable updates, proper state copying
```

## Investigation Plan

1. **State Creation Flow**
   - ✓ Transformation state initialization verified
   - ✓ Parent state handling in factory verified
   - ⚠️ Need to verify transformation flag inheritance

2. **State Modification**
   - ✓ Methods properly clone state
   - ✓ Immutability maintained
   - ⚠️ Need to verify transformation consistency across operations

3. **State Inheritance**
   - ✓ Parent/child relationship mapped
   - ⚠️ Need to verify transformation state in complex scenarios
   - ⚠️ Need to test circular reference handling

## Next Steps

1. Create test cases for:
   - Circular parent references
   - Deep transformation state inheritance
   - Complex state merging scenarios
   - Transformation flag consistency

2. Add validation for:
   - Parent/child relationship consistency
   - Transformed node validity
   - Circular reference detection

3. Document transformation state lifecycle:
   - When transformation flags should be inherited
   - How transformed nodes should be validated
   - Best practices for state merging

## Questions to Answer

1. **State Initialization**
   - When should transformation be enabled?
   - Should child states inherit transformation settings?
   - How should transformed nodes be initialized?

2. **State Operations**
   - What's the correct order for copying state?
   - How should transformed nodes be merged?
   - When should transformation state be preserved?

3. **Factory Behavior**
   - Should factory be transformation-aware?
   - How should it handle parent state?
   - What's the correct state copying depth?

## Test Coverage Needed

1. **State Inheritance**
   - Parent/child transformation inheritance
   - Transformation state in merged states
   - Cloned state consistency

2. **State Operations**
   - Node transformation tracking
   - State immutability with transformations
   - Error handling in transformation operations

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Partial transformations
   - Nested state inheritance
   - Complex state merging

## Test Coverage Analysis

### Existing Test Coverage
1. Basic State Operations
   - ✓ State creation and initialization
   - ✓ Variable management (text, data, path)
   - ✓ Command handling
   - ✓ Import management
   - ✓ Node operations

2. Transformation State
   - ✓ Basic transformation enabling/disabling
   - ✓ Node transformation tracking
   - ✓ Transformation state preservation in cloning
   - ✓ Immutability checks with transformations

3. State Inheritance
   - ✓ Basic parent/child state creation
   - ✓ Simple state merging
   - ✓ Variable inheritance and overriding

### Test Coverage Gaps

1. Complex Transformation Scenarios
   ```typescript
   // Need tests for:
   - Nested child states with transformations enabled/disabled at different levels
   - Merging states with conflicting transformed nodes
   - Transformation state preservation across multiple inheritance levels
   ```

2. Edge Cases
   ```typescript
   // Missing tests for:
   - Circular parent references
   - Invalid state merges
   - Incomplete or corrupted state
   ```

3. State Validation
   ```typescript
   // Need validation tests for:
   - Node array consistency
   - Parent/child relationship integrity
   - Transformation state validity
   ```

### Required Test Cases

1. **Transformation Inheritance**
   ```typescript
   it('should handle transformation flags in nested states', () => {
     const parent = new StateService();
     parent.enableTransformation(true);
     const child = parent.createChildState();
     const grandchild = child.createChildState();

     // Verify transformation state inheritance
     expect(child.isTransformationEnabled()).toBe(true);
     expect(grandchild.isTransformationEnabled()).toBe(true);
   });

   it('should merge transformed nodes correctly in complex hierarchies', () => {
     const parent = new StateService();
     const child1 = parent.createChildState();
     const child2 = parent.createChildState();

     // Setup different transformation states
     parent.enableTransformation(true);
     child1.enableTransformation(true);
     child2.enableTransformation(false);

     // Verify correct merging behavior
   });
   ```

2. **State Validation**
   ```typescript
   it('should detect circular parent references', () => {
     const parent = new StateService();
     const child = parent.createChildState();

     // Attempt to create circular reference
     expect(() => parent.mergeChildState(child))
       .toThrow('Circular parent reference detected');
   });

   it('should validate transformed nodes match originals', () => {
     const service = new StateService();
     service.enableTransformation(true);

     // Add original node
     const original = createTestNode('original');
     service.addNode(original);

     // Attempt invalid transformation
     const invalid = createTestNode('invalid');
     expect(() => service.transformNode(invalid, invalid))
       .toThrow('Cannot transform node: original node not found');
   });
   ```

3. **Complex State Operations**
   ```typescript
   it('should handle deep cloning with transformations', () => {
     const original = new StateService();
     original.enableTransformation(true);

     // Setup complex state
     const node1 = createTestNode('node1');
     const node2 = createTestNode('node2');
     original.addNode(node1);
     original.addNode(node2);

     // Transform nodes
     const transformed1 = createTestNode('transformed1');
     original.transformNode(node1, transformed1);

     // Clone and verify
     const cloned = original.clone();
     expect(cloned.getTransformedNodes()).toEqual(original.getTransformedNodes());
     expect(cloned.isTransformationEnabled()).toBe(true);
   });

   it('should preserve transformation state in complex merges', () => {
     const parent = new StateService();
     const child1 = parent.createChildState();
     const child2 = parent.createChildState();

     // Setup different states
     parent.enableTransformation(true);
     child1.enableTransformation(true);
     child2.enableTransformation(false);

     // Add and transform nodes
     const parentNode = createTestNode('parent');
     const child1Node = createTestNode('child1');
     const child2Node = createTestNode('child2');

     parent.addNode(parentNode);
     child1.addNode(child1Node);
     child2.addNode(child2Node);

     // Transform some nodes
     const transformed = createTestNode('transformed');
     child1.transformNode(child1Node, transformed);

     // Merge and verify
     parent.mergeChildState(child1);
     parent.mergeChildState(child2);

     // Verify correct node ordering and transformation state
   });
   ```

### Implementation Recommendations

1. Add Validation Layer
   ```typescript
   class StateValidator {
     static validateParentReference(state: StateNode): void {
       // Check for circular references
       let current = state;
       const visited = new Set<StateNode>();
       while (current.parentState) {
         if (visited.has(current.parentState)) {
           throw new Error('Circular parent reference detected');
         }
         visited.add(current);
         current = current.parentState;
       }
     }

     static validateTransformedNodes(state: StateNode): void {
       if (!state.transformedNodes) return;
       if (state.transformedNodes.length !== state.nodes.length) {
         throw new Error('Transformed nodes array length mismatch');
       }
       // Add additional validation as needed
     }
   }
   ```

2. Enhance State Factory
   ```typescript
   class StateFactory {
     createState(options?: StateNodeOptions): StateNode {
       const state = // ... existing creation code ...

       // Add validation
       StateValidator.validateParentReference(state);
       StateValidator.validateTransformedNodes(state);

       return state;
     }
   }
   ```

3. Improve Error Handling
   ```typescript
   class StateService {
     mergeChildState(childState: IStateService): void {
       this.checkMutable();
       const child = childState as StateService;

       try {
         // Validate before merge
         StateValidator.validateParentReference(child.currentState);
         StateValidator.validateTransformedNodes(child.currentState);

         this.currentState = this.stateFactory.mergeStates(
           this.currentState,
           child.currentState
         );
       } catch (error) {
         logger.error('State merge failed', { error });
         throw new Error(`Invalid state merge: ${error.message}`);
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Next Steps

1. Implement test cases in priority order:
   - Transformation inheritance tests
   - State validation tests
   - Complex merge tests

2. Add validation layer:
   - Create StateValidator class
   - Add validation to factory operations
   - Enhance error handling

3. Document best practices:
   - When to enable/disable transformations
   - How to handle complex state merges
   - Validation requirements

## Mock Implementation Analysis

### 1. Mock Service Variants

1. Legacy InterpreterState (`tests/mocks/state.ts`):
   ```typescript
   export class InterpreterState {
     private nodes: MeldNode[] = [];
     private textVars: Map<string, string> = new Map();
     private dataVars: Map<string, any> = new Map();
     private commands: Map<string, string> = new Map();
     private imports: Set<string> = new Set();
     // Missing transformation state completely
   }
   ```
   Issues:
   - No transformation support
   - Doesn't implement full IStateService interface
   - Used in older tests that may need updating

2. Factory Mock (`testFactories.ts`):
   ```typescript
   export function createMockStateService(): IStateService {
     const mockService = {
       // Has all interface methods but behavior doesn't match real service
       getTransformedNodes: vi.fn(),
       setTransformedNodes: vi.fn(),
       transformNode: vi.fn(),
       isTransformationEnabled: vi.fn(),
       enableTransformation: vi.fn(),
       // ...
     };
     // Default implementations don't match real service behavior
     mockService.isTransformationEnabled.mockImplementation(() => false);
     mockService.getTransformedNodes.mockImplementation(() => []);
   }
   ```
   Issues:
   - Transformation state not properly preserved
   - Clone operation doesn't copy all state
   - Child state creation doesn't inherit parent state

3. Real Service in TestContext:
   ```typescript
   // In TestContext.ts
   const state = new StateService();
   state.setCurrentFilePath('test.meld');
   state.enableTransformation(true); // Different default than mock
   ```
   Issues:
   - Inconsistent with mock defaults
   - May hide problems in tests using mocks

### 2. Behavioral Mismatches

1. State Inheritance:
   ```typescript
   // Real Service
   createChildState(): IStateService {
     const child = new StateService(this);
     // Inherits transformation state and nodes
     return child;
   }

   // Mock Service
   createChildState: vi.fn().mockImplementation(() => createMockStateService())
   // Creates fresh mock without inheritance
   ```

2. Transformation State:
   ```typescript
   // Real Service
   enableTransformation(enable: boolean): void {
     if (enable) {
       this.updateState({
         transformedNodes: [...this.currentState.nodes]
       }, 'enableTransformation');
     }
     this._transformationEnabled = enable;
   }

   // Mock Service
   enableTransformation: vi.fn()
   // No state initialization or preservation
   ```

3. State Cloning:
   ```typescript
   // Real Service - Full state preservation
   clone(): IStateService {
     const cloned = new StateService();
     cloned.currentState = this.stateFactory.createState({...});
     cloned._transformationEnabled = this._transformationEnabled;
     return cloned;
   }

   // Mock Service - Partial state copying
   clone: vi.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
     const newMock = createMockStateService();
     newMock.getNodes.mockImplementation(() => [...mockService.getNodes()]);
     return newMock;
   })
   ```

### 3. Test Impact Analysis

1. Affected Test Types:
   - Unit tests using legacy InterpreterState
   - Integration tests mixing real and mock services
   - API tests with transformation expectations
   - Output service tests requiring transformed nodes

2. Failure Patterns:
   - Missing transformation state in child states
   - Inconsistent node arrays after cloning
   - Lost state during service interactions
   - Transformation flags not preserved

3. Risk Areas:
   - Directive processing with transformation
   - State inheritance chains
   - Complex state merging operations
   - Cross-service interactions

### 4. Required Alignments

1. Interface Compliance:
   ```typescript
   interface IStateService {
     // All mocks must implement these transformation methods
     getTransformedNodes(): MeldNode[];
     setTransformedNodes(nodes: MeldNode[]): void;
     transformNode(original: MeldNode, transformed: MeldNode): void;
     isTransformationEnabled(): boolean;
     enableTransformation(enable: boolean): void;
   }
   ```

2. Behavioral Consistency:
   - State inheritance in child states
   - Transformation state preservation
   - Node array management
   - Cloning and merging operations

3. Default Settings:
   - Transformation enabled/disabled state
   - Initial node arrays
   - Parent/child relationships
   - State immutability

### 5. Investigation Needed

1. Test Coverage:
   - Which tests use which mock variants?
   - Are transformation tests comprehensive?
   - Do integration tests verify state preservation?

2. State Lifecycle:
   - How is transformation state propagated?
   - When should state be preserved vs reset?
   - What are the valid state transitions?

3. Mock Migration:
   - Can we deprecate legacy mocks?
   - How to update affected tests?
   - What's the migration timeline?

\==== ATTEMPT 1 part c (sidequest assuming the 'solution' had been identified)

## NEW: Transformation Flow Analysis

1. **DirectiveService Implementation Issue**:
   ```typescript
   // In DirectiveService.processDirective:
   const result = await handler.execute(node, context);
   return result.state;  // <-- CRITICAL: Discarding replacement node!
   ```
   - DirectiveService gets replacement nodes from handlers but doesn't use them
   - Handlers properly generate replacements (verified in RunDirectiveHandler, ImportDirectiveHandler, etc.)
   - But DirectiveService only returns the state, losing the transformations

2. **Handler Behavior**:
   - Handlers correctly implement transformation:
     ```typescript
     // Example from RunDirectiveHandler:
     if (clonedState.isTransformationEnabled()) {
       return {
         state: clonedState,
         replacement: {
           type: 'Text',
           content: stdout,
           location: node.location
         }
       };
     }
     ```
   - All execution handlers follow this pattern
   - Definition handlers return empty text nodes when transformed

3. **State Management**:
   - State tracks transformation correctly:
     - `isTransformationEnabled()`
     - `setTransformedNodes()`
     - `transformNode()`
   - But transformations never make it to OutputService

4. **Expected vs Actual Flow**:
   - Expected:
     1. DirectiveService processes directive
     2. Handler returns replacement node
     3. DirectiveService updates state's transformed nodes
     4. OutputService receives transformed nodes
   - Actual:
     1. DirectiveService processes directive
     2. Handler returns replacement node
     3. DirectiveService discards replacement
     4. OutputService gets original nodes

## NEW: InterpreterService Analysis

1. **Node Processing Flow**:
   ```typescript
   // In InterpreterService.interpretNode:
   case 'Directive':
     const directiveState = currentState.clone();
     directiveState.addNode(node);  // Adds original node
     currentState = await this.directiveService.processDirective(directiveNode, {
       state: directiveState,
       currentFilePath: state.getCurrentFilePath() ?? undefined
     });
   ```
   - InterpreterService adds original node to state BEFORE processing
   - Then calls DirectiveService but discards any replacement nodes
   - This means transformed nodes are never stored in state

2. **State Management**:
   - Creates clean state for each node interpretation
   - Properly clones state to maintain immutability
   - But doesn't handle transformed nodes specially
   - No awareness of transformation mode

3. **Pipeline Flow**:
   ```
   InterpreterService
     -> Adds original node to state
     -> Calls DirectiveService.processDirective
        -> Handler returns {state, replacement}
        -> DirectiveService discards replacement
     -> Returns only state
   ```
   This means:
   - Original nodes are preserved in state
   - Transformed nodes are generated but lost
   - OutputService only sees original nodes

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Primary Issue**:
   - DirectiveService discards replacement nodes from handlers
   - But the problem is more systemic:
     1. InterpreterService adds original nodes before transformation
     2. DirectiveService discards replacements
     3. No service is responsible for managing transformed node list

2. **Required Changes**:
   a) DirectiveService needs to:
      - Store replacement nodes in state when transformation enabled
      - Use `state.transformNode()` to track replacements

   b) InterpreterService should:
      - NOT add original nodes for directives in transformation mode
      - OR add them but mark them for replacement
      - Let DirectiveService handle node storage in transformation mode

3. **Verification Points**:
   - Check if StateService's transformed nodes array is ever populated
   - Verify if any service calls `state.transformNode()`
   - Look for transformation mode checks in node storage logic

## Next Steps

1. **Fix DirectiveService First**:
   ```typescript
   // Current:
   return result.state;

   // Should be:
   if (context.state.isTransformationEnabled?.() && result.replacement) {
     result.state.transformNode(node, result.replacement);
   }
   return result.state;
   ```

2. **Then Review InterpreterService**:
   - Consider moving node addition after directive processing
   - Add transformation mode awareness
   - Ensure proper state inheritance of transformed nodes

3. **Finally Check OutputService**:
   - Verify it properly checks for transformed nodes
   - Ensure it uses the right node list based on mode

4. **Test Coverage**:
   - Add tests for transformation state inheritance
   - Verify node replacement in transformation mode
   - Test state cloning with transformed nodes

## Mock Implementation Analysis

1. **Multiple Mock Implementations**:
   - Found two different state mocking approaches:
     a) `MockStateService` class in `OutputService.test.ts` - full implementation
     b) `vi.fn()` based mocks in transformation tests
   - Need to verify consistency between these approaches

2. **Mock State Service Implementation**:
   ```typescript
   class MockStateService implements IStateService {
     private transformationEnabled = false;
     private transformedNodes: MeldNode[] = [];

     // Has complete transformation methods:
     isTransformationEnabled()
     enableTransformation()
     setTransformedNodes()
     getTransformedNodes()
     transformNode()
   }
   ```
   - Complete implementation of transformation interface
   - Proper state tracking for transformed nodes
   - Correct inheritance in `createChildState()`

## OutputService Investigation

1. **Node Selection Logic**:
   ```typescript
   // In OutputService.convert():
   const nodesToProcess = state.isTransformationEnabled() && state.getTransformedNodes().length > 0
     ? state.getTransformedNodes()
     : nodes;
   ```
   Questions to investigate:
   - Is this check for existing transformed nodes intentional?
   - How should transformed nodes be populated in production?
   - What's the relationship between manual `setTransformedNodes()` and the transformation pipeline?

2. **Test Setup Pattern**:
   ```typescript
   state.enableTransformation();
   state.setTransformedNodes(transformedNodes);
   ```
   Need to verify:
   - Is this manual node setting the intended pattern?
   - Should we test the full transformation pipeline instead?
   - How do transformed nodes get populated in real usage?

## Next Steps

1. **Continue Service Audit**:
   - Review InterpreterService implementation
   - Understand transformation pipeline flow
   - Map out how transformed nodes should be populated

2. **Test Infrastructure**:
   - Consolidate mock implementations
   - Verify test patterns match intended usage
   - Consider adding pipeline integration tests

3. **Documentation**:
   - Map complete transformation lifecycle
   - Document intended state inheritance patterns
   - Clarify transformation pipeline responsibilities

4. **Verification Points**:
   - How transformed nodes get populated in production
   - Service responsibilities in transformation pipeline
   - Error handling expectations across pipeline

# Meld Codebase Audit

## Methodology

1. **Evidence-Based Investigation**
   - Every claim must be backed by actual code evidence
   - No assumptions without verification
   - Document uncertainty explicitly
   - Track what we've verified vs what we're speculating

2. **Investigation Process**
   - Start with the failing test symptoms
   - Trace through the actual code paths
   - Document each verified fact
   - Note gaps in understanding

3. **Documentation Standards**
   - Include file:line references for all claims
   - Quote relevant code directly
   - Mark assumptions with "ASSUMPTION:"
   - Mark uncertainties with "UNKNOWN:"
   - Mark verified facts with "VERIFIED:"

## Current Investigation

### 1. Reported Issues

VERIFIED: From PLAN.md, we have two categories of failing tests:
1. 4 tests in api/api.test.ts with "currentState.clone is not a function"
2. 3 tests in OutputService around transformation mode

### 2. Initial Code Evidence

VERIFIED: The IStateService interface exists and defines clone():
```typescript:services/StateService/IStateService.ts
interface IStateService {
  // ... other methods ...
  clone(): IStateService;
}
```

VERIFIED: The real StateService implements clone():
```typescript:services/StateService/StateService.ts
export class StateService implements IStateService {
  clone(): IStateService {
    const cloned = new StateService();
    cloned.currentState = this.stateFactory.createState({...});
    cloned._transformationEnabled = this._transformationEnabled;
    return cloned;
  }
}
```

### 3. New Evidence from Test Files

VERIFIED: The OutputService tests use a complete mock implementation:
```typescript:services/OutputService/OutputService.test.ts
class MockStateService implements IStateService {
  // Has proper clone implementation
  clone(): IStateService {
    const cloned = new MockStateService();
    cloned.textVars = new Map(this.textVars);
    cloned.dataVars = new Map(this.dataVars);
    cloned.pathVars = new Map(this.pathVars);
    cloned.commands = new Map(this.commands);
    cloned.nodes = [...this.nodes];
    cloned.transformationEnabled = this.transformationEnabled;
    cloned.transformedNodes = [...this.transformedNodes];
    cloned.imports = new Set(this.imports);
    cloned.filePath = this.filePath;
    cloned._isImmutable = this._isImmutable;
    return cloned;
  }
}
```

VERIFIED: The api/api.test.ts uses TestContext which initializes real services:
```typescript:api/api.test.ts
describe('SDK Integration Tests', () => {
  let context: TestContext;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    context = new TestContext();
    await context.initialize();
    testFilePath = 'test.meld';
  });
```

VERIFIED: TestContext uses real StateService:
```typescript:tests/utils/TestContext.ts
const state = new StateService();
state.setCurrentFilePath('test.meld');
state.enableTransformation(true); // Enable transformation by default for tests
```

### 4. Key Findings

1. **Mock Implementation Status**:
   - VERIFIED: OutputService tests use a complete mock with proper clone()
   - VERIFIED: API tests use real StateService through TestContext
   - UNKNOWN: Why are we seeing "clone is not a function" if both implementations have clone()?

2. **Transformation Handling**:
   - VERIFIED: OutputService has extensive transformation mode tests
   - VERIFIED: TestContext enables transformation by default
   - VERIFIED: OutputService.convert() properly handles transformed nodes:
   ```typescript:services/OutputService/OutputService.ts
   const nodesToProcess = state.isTransformationEnabled() && state.getTransformedNodes().length > 0
     ? state.getTransformedNodes()
     : nodes;
   ```

3. **Service Initialization**:
   - VERIFIED: TestContext properly initializes all services
   - VERIFIED: API main() function accepts services from test context
   - UNKNOWN: Could there be a timing issue with service initialization?

### 5. Uncertainties Requiring Investigation

1. Clone() Method Mystery:
   - Both real and mock implementations have clone()
   - API tests use real service which has clone()
   - Yet we're seeing "clone is not a function"
   - NEED TO INVESTIGATE: Is the service being replaced or modified somewhere?

2. Transformation Mode Issues:
   - OutputService tests pass with mock implementation
   - TestContext enables transformation by default
   - NEED TO INVESTIGATE: Are the failing tests using a different setup?

### 6. Mock Implementation Evidence

VERIFIED: We have found three different mock implementations of StateService:

1. **OutputService Test Mock** (`services/OutputService/OutputService.test.ts`):
   ```typescript
   class MockStateService implements IStateService {
     clone(): IStateService {
       const cloned = new MockStateService();
       // Properly copies all state
       cloned.textVars = new Map(this.textVars);
       // ... other state copying ...
       return cloned;
     }
   }
   ```
   - ✓ Implements full interface
   - ✓ Has proper clone() implementation
   - ✓ Maintains transformation state

2. **Test Factory Mock** (`tests/utils/testFactories.ts`):
   ```typescript
   export function createMockStateService(): IStateService {
     const mockService = {
       clone: vi.fn()
     };
     mockService.clone.mockImplementation(() => {
       const newMock = createMockStateService();
       // Copies state via mock implementations
       newMock.getNodes.mockImplementation(mockService.getNodes);
       // ... other mock copying ...
       return newMock;
     });
     return mockService as unknown as IStateService;
   }
   ```
   - ✓ Has clone() method
   - ✓ Copies mock implementations in clone
   - ? Potential issue: Uses `as unknown as IStateService` cast

3. **Legacy Mock** (`tests/mocks/state.ts`):
   ```typescript
   export class InterpreterState {
     // No clone() implementation
     // No transformation methods
   }
   ```
   - ✗ Missing clone() method
   - ✗ Missing transformation methods
   - ✗ Doesn't implement IStateService interface

### 7. Service Initialization Evidence

VERIFIED: The API test setup uses TestContext:
```typescript:api/api.test.ts
beforeEach(async () => {
  context = new TestContext();
  await context.initialize();
  testFilePath = 'test.meld';
});
```

VERIFIED: TestContext uses real StateService:
```typescript:tests/utils/TestContext.ts
const state = new StateService();
state.setCurrentFilePath('test.meld');
state.enableTransformation(true);
```

VERIFIED: The API main() function accepts services:
```typescript:api/index.ts
export async function main(filePath: string, options: ProcessOptions & { services?: any } = {}): Promise<string> {
  if (options.services) {
    const { parser, interpreter, directive, validation, state, path, circularity, resolution, output } = options.services;
    // ... uses these services ...
  }
}
```

### 8. Key Findings Update

1. **Mock Implementation Inconsistency**:
   - We have three different mock implementations with varying completeness
   - The legacy `InterpreterState` mock is missing required methods
   - The test factory mock uses type casting which could hide issues

2. **Service Initialization Path**:
   - TestContext -> real StateService -> API main() function
   - No obvious point where the service would lose its clone() method
   - Type casting in the mock factory could be relevant

3. **Type Safety Concerns**:
   - `as unknown as IStateService` cast in test factory mock
   - Legacy mock doesn't implement interface but might be used
   - Service parameter in main() typed as `any`

### 9. Legacy Mock Usage Evidence

VERIFIED: The legacy InterpreterState is only imported in:
1. `tests/mocks/setup.ts`
2. `tests/mocks/directive-handlers.ts`

VERIFIED: The legacy mock is NOT used in the API tests. The API tests use TestContext which uses real StateService:
```typescript:api/api.test.ts
describe('SDK Integration Tests', () => {
  let context: TestContext;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    context = new TestContext();
    await context.initialize();
    testFilePath = 'test.meld';
  });

  // All tests use context.services which contains real StateService
  const result = await main(testFilePath, {
    fs: context.fs,
    services: context.services
  });
```

UNKNOWN: We still haven't seen the actual failing tests. The api/api.test.ts file we can see shows:
- Format Conversion tests (2 tests)
- Full Pipeline Integration tests (2 tests)
- Error Handling tests (2 tests + 1 todo)
- Edge Cases (2 todos)

None of these tests appear to be the ones failing with "clone is not a function".

### 10. Revised Investigation Plan

1. **Find Missing Tests**:
   - The failing tests must be in a different file or section
   - Need to find where clone() is actually being called
   - Need to verify if there are more api/api.test.ts files

2. **Service Initialization Check**:
   - VERIFIED: TestContext properly initializes real StateService
   - VERIFIED: API tests properly pass services through
   - VERIFIED: Legacy mock is not directly involved

3. **Next Steps**:
   1. Search for all test files that might contain "api.test.ts"
   2. Search for all usages of clone() in test files
   3. Add logging in main() to verify service object structure
   4. Check if any other test files might be using the legacy mock

### Current Uncertainties

1. UNKNOWN: Location of failing tests
   - We haven't found the actual failing tests
   - The api/api.test.ts we can see doesn't show clone() usage

2. UNKNOWN: Clone() call sites
   - Where is clone() being called?
   - What's the stack trace of the failures?

3. UNKNOWN: Service object integrity
   - Is the service object being modified between creation and use?
   - Could there be multiple api/api.test.ts files?

### Next Actions

1. Search for test files:
   ```bash
   find . -name "api.test.ts"
   ```
   - Look for any other test files that might contain the failing tests

2. Search for clone() usage:
   ```typescript
   // Search in test files for:
   state.clone()
   currentState.clone()
   ```
   - Find where clone() is actually being called

3. Add debug logging:
   ```typescript
   export async function main(filePath: string, options: ProcessOptions & { services?: any } = {}): Promise<string> {
     if (options.services) {
       const { state } = options.services;
       console.log('State service type:', state?.constructor?.name);
       console.log('Has clone:', typeof state?.clone === 'function');
     }
   }
   ```
   - Add to main() to track service object integrity

## Next Actions

1. Locate and examine api/api.test.ts
2. Locate and examine the OutputService tests
3. Document the exact failure scenarios with evidence
4. Trace the service initialization in each failing test

### 11. New Evidence: Clone Usage

VERIFIED: clone() is called in several service implementations:

1. **InterpreterService**:
```typescript:services/InterpreterService/InterpreterService.ts
const initialSnapshot = currentState.clone();
const preNodeState = state.clone();
const textState = currentState.clone();
const directiveState = currentState.clone();
```

2. **DirectiveService**:
```typescript:services/DirectiveService/DirectiveService.ts
let currentState = parentContext?.state?.clone() || this.stateService!.createChildState();
state: parentContext?.state?.clone() || this.stateService!.createChildState()
```

3. **Directive Handlers**:
```typescript
// RunDirectiveHandler
const clonedState = state.clone();

// EmbedDirectiveHandler
const newState = context.state.clone();

// ImportDirectiveHandler
const clonedState = context.state.clone();

// DataDirectiveHandler
const newState = context.state.clone();
```

VERIFIED: clone() is tested in StateService tests:
```typescript:services/StateService/StateService.test.ts
const clone = state.clone();
```

### 12. Test File Evidence

VERIFIED: Only one api.test.ts file exists:
```
/Users/adam/dev/meld/api/api.test.ts
```

UNKNOWN: The api.test.ts file we can see doesn't show the failing tests, but we know:
1. The tests exist (from error messages)
2. They use clone() (from error messages)
3. They're in api.test.ts (from error messages)

This suggests:
1. Either we're not seeing the full api.test.ts file
2. Or the tests are in a different branch/version

### 13. Key Findings Update

1. **Clone Usage Pattern**:
   - clone() is used extensively throughout the codebase
   - Primarily used for state snapshots and child contexts
   - Used in both service implementations and tests

2. **Service Dependencies**:
   - InterpreterService depends on clone()
   - DirectiveService depends on clone()
   - All directive handlers depend on clone()

3. **Test Coverage**:
   - StateService has dedicated clone() tests
   - clone() is used in transformation tests
   - The failing API tests are not visible in our current view

### Next Actions Update

1. **Verify Full File Contents**:
   ```typescript
   // Try to read api/api.test.ts with different methods
   // Check if file might be truncated
   ```

2. **Add Strategic Logging**:
   ```typescript
   // In InterpreterService
   interpret(nodes: MeldNode[], options?: InterpretOptions): Promise<IStateService> {
     console.log('State type:', options?.initialState?.constructor?.name);
     const currentState = options?.initialState?.clone();
     console.log('Cloned state type:', currentState?.constructor?.name);
   }

   // In DirectiveService
   initialize(...services): void {
     console.log('StateService type:', this.stateService?.constructor?.name);
   }
   ```

3. **Check Service Initialization Chain**:
   - TestContext creates real StateService
   - Passes to main() in api/index.ts
   - main() uses in interpreter/directive services
   - Need to verify this chain remains intact

4. Questions to Answer:
   - Why can't we see the failing tests?
   - Is the file truncated or are we looking at the wrong version?
   - Could the service be getting replaced somewhere in the chain?

### 14. File Access Evidence

VERIFIED: We can read api/api.test.ts, but:
1. The file shows only 151 lines
2. The read_file tool notes "Showing the first few lines instead"
3. The file is not in the list of manually attached files

This strongly suggests:
1. We're only seeing a partial view of the file
2. The failing tests might be in the part we can't see
3. We need to get access to the full file

### 15. Service Chain Analysis

VERIFIED: The service initialization chain we can see is correct:
```typescript
// TestContext creates real service
const state = new StateService();
state.setCurrentFilePath('test.meld');
state.enableTransformation(true);

// API test passes it through
const result = await main(testFilePath, {
  fs: context.fs,
  services: context.services
});

// main() uses it
if (options.services) {
  const { parser, interpreter, directive, validation, state, path, circularity, resolution, output } = options.services;
  // ... uses these services ...
}
```

UNKNOWN: What happens after service extraction in main(). We need to see:
1. How the services are used
2. Where clone() is called
3. Whether services are modified

### Next Actions Update

1. **Get Full File Access**:
   - Request full api/api.test.ts file
   - Look for file in different branches/versions
   - Check if file is split into multiple files

2. **Add Defensive Checks**:
   ```typescript
   // In main()
   if (options.services) {
     const { state } = options.services;
     if (!state || typeof state.clone !== 'function') {
       console.error('Invalid state service:', {
         hasState: !!state,
         type: state?.constructor?.name,
         hasClone: typeof state?.clone === 'function'
       });
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Service Usage Verification**:
   - Add logging before each clone() call
   - Track service object through the chain
   - Check for service replacement points

4. Questions to Answer:
   - Is the file actually longer than 151 lines?
   - Are there multiple api.test.ts files in different locations?
   - Could the tests be in a different branch?

### 16. Test Failure Evidence

VERIFIED: Running `npm test` revealed three distinct categories of failures:

1. **API Integration Test Failures** (5 tests):
   ```
   api/api.test.ts > SDK Integration Tests:
   - Format Conversion:
     × should handle definition directives correctly
       Error: "Unexpected directive in transformed nodes"
     × should handle execution directives correctly
       Error: "currentState.clone is not a function at line 1, column 2"
     × should handle complex meld content with mixed directives
       Error: "currentState.clone is not a function at line 5, column 10"
   - Full Pipeline Integration:
     × should handle the complete parse -> interpret -> convert pipeline
       Error: "currentState.clone is not a function at line 3, column 10"
     × should preserve state and content in transformation mode
       Error: "currentState.clone is not a function at line 4, column 10"
   ```

2. **DirectiveService Import Test Failures** (2 tests):
   ```
   services/DirectiveService/DirectiveService.test.ts:
   - should process basic import
     Error: "result.getTextVar is not a function"
   - should handle nested imports
     Error: "result.getTextVar is not a function"
   ```

3. **OutputService Transformation Test Failures** (3 tests):
   ```
   services/OutputService/OutputService.test.ts:
   - should use transformed nodes when transformation is enabled
     Error: Expected 'echo test\n' to be 'test output\n'
   - should handle mixed content in transformation mode
     Error: Expected 'Before\necho test\nAfter\n' to be 'Before\ntest output\nAfter\n'
   - should handle LLM output in both modes
     Error: Expected 'Before\necho test\nAfter' to contain 'test output'
   ```

### Key Findings from Test Results

1. **Clone Function Issues**:
   - VERIFIED: The "clone is not a function" error occurs in 4 API tests
   - VERIFIED: All clone errors happen in the interpreter phase
   - VERIFIED: The errors occur at different line numbers (1, 3, 4, 5)
   - VERIFIED: The error message format is consistent across all failures

2. **State Service Interface Issues**:
   - VERIFIED: DirectiveService tests expect `getTextVar()` method
   - VERIFIED: The result object doesn't have this method
   - This suggests a type mismatch or incorrect service implementation

3. **Transformation Mode Issues**:
   - VERIFIED: OutputService is not transforming run directives
   - VERIFIED: Expected "test output" but getting "echo test"
   - This suggests transformation is not being applied correctly

### Next Actions Update

1. **Clone Function Investigation**:
   ```typescript
   // Add logging in InterpreterService
   interpret(nodes: MeldNode[], options?: InterpretOptions): Promise<IStateService> {
     console.log('State before clone:', {
       type: options?.initialState?.constructor?.name,
       hasClone: typeof options?.initialState?.clone === 'function',
       prototype: Object.getPrototypeOf(options?.initialState)
     });
   }
   ```

2. **State Service Interface Check**:
   ```typescript
   // Add type checking in DirectiveService
   processImport(directive: ImportDirective, context: DirectiveContext): Promise<IStateService> {
     console.log('Result type:', {
       type: context.state?.constructor?.name,
       methods: Object.getOwnPropertyNames(Object.getPrototypeOf(context.state))
     });
   }
   ```

3. **Transformation Mode Debug**:
   ```typescript
   // Add logging in OutputService
   convert(nodes: MeldNode[], state: IStateService, format: string): Promise<string> {
     console.log('Transformation state:', {
       enabled: state.isTransformationEnabled(),
       hasTransformed: state.getTransformedNodes().length > 0,
       nodes: nodes.map(n => n.type)
     });
   }
   ```

4. Questions to Answer:
   - Why is the state object missing clone() in API tests but not others?
   - Why is the DirectiveService result missing getTextVar()?
   - Why isn't transformation being applied to run directives?

### 17. Root Cause Analysis

After examining the code paths and test failures, I've identified the root cause:

1. **Mock State Contamination**:
   ```typescript
   // In DirectiveService.processDirectives:
   let currentState = parentContext?.state?.clone() || this.stateService!.createChildState();
   ```
   - The state object is getting cloned multiple times
   - If ANY clone in the chain is a mock, all subsequent states are mocks
   - Mocks don't properly implement the IStateService interface

2. **Service Initialization Chain**:
   ```typescript
   // In api/index.ts main():
   if (options.services) {
     const { parser, interpreter, directive, validation, state, path, circularity, resolution, output } = options.services;
     // ... initialize services ...
     const resultState = await interpreter.interpret(ast, { filePath, initialState: state });
   }
   ```
   - The API tests pass services from TestContext
   - TestContext uses real services
   - But somewhere in the chain, a mock state is getting introduced

3. **Test Setup Issues**:
   ```typescript
   // In ImportDirectiveHandler.test.ts:
   childState = {
     setTextVar: vi.fn(),
     // ... other mocks ...
     clone: vi.fn()
   } as unknown as IStateService;
   ```
   - The handler tests use incomplete mock states
   - These mocks don't properly implement clone()
   - Type casting hides the interface mismatch

### Next Actions

1. **Fix Mock Implementation**:
   ```typescript
   // In tests/utils/testFactories.ts:
   export function createMockStateService(): IStateService {
     const mockService = {
       // ... other mocks ...
       clone: vi.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
         // Create a NEW real StateService instead of a mock
         const newState = new StateService();
         // Copy state from mock to real service
         mockService.getAllTextVars().forEach((v, k) => newState.setTextVar(k, v));
         mockService.getAllDataVars().forEach((v, k) => newState.setDataVar(k, v));
         return newState;
       })
     };
     return mockService;
   }
   ```

2. **Add Type Safety**:
   ```typescript
   // In DirectiveService.ts:
   private ensureValidState(state: IStateService): void {
     if (typeof state.clone !== 'function') {
       throw new Error('Invalid state service: missing clone() method');
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Fix Test Context**:
   ```typitten
   // In TestContext.ts:
   constructor() {
     // ... existing setup ...
     const state = new StateService(); // Ensure we use real state
     state.setCurrentFilePath('test.meld');
     state.enableTransformation(true);
     // ... continue setup ...
   }
   ```

4. Questions to Answer:
   - Are there other places where mock states are being introduced?
   - Should we prevent type casting in tests?
   - Do we need to audit other service mocks for completeness?

### 18. Mock State Service Implementation Evidence

VERIFIED: The mock state service in `tests/utils/testFactories.ts` has a critical implementation:

```typescript
export function createMockStateService(): IStateService {
  const mockService = {
    clone: vi.fn(),
  };

  mockService.clone.mockImplementation(() => {
    const newMock = createMockStateService();
    // Copy all state via mock implementations
    newMock.getTextVar.mockImplementation(mockService.getTextVar);
    newMock.getDataVar.mockImplementation(mockService.getDataVar);
    // ... other state copying ...
    return newMock;
  });

  return mockService as unknown as IStateService;
}
```

Key Findings:
1. VERIFIED: The mock uses `as unknown as IStateService` type casting
2. VERIFIED: The mock's clone() creates a new mock service recursively
3. VERIFIED: State is copied by copying mock implementations, not actual data

This evidence suggests:
1. Type casting could hide interface mismatches
2. Each clone creates a new chain of mocks
3. The mock implementation differs significantly from the real StateService's clone behavior

Questions Raised:
1. Could the type casting allow invalid states to propagate?
2. Is the recursive mock creation causing the clone() failures?
3. Are test files mixing real and mock state services?

### 19. Mock State Service Usage Patterns

VERIFIED: The mock state service is used in several test files:

1. **Directive Handler Tests**:
   ```typescript
   // TextDirectiveHandler.test.ts, DefineDirectiveHandler.test.ts
   let stateService: ReturnType<typeof createMockStateService>;
   ```

2. **Resolution Service Tests**:
   ```typescript
   // VariableReferenceResolver.test.ts, ContentResolver.test.ts
   stateService = createMockStateService();
   ```

3. **Integration Tests**:
   ```typescript
   // TextDirectiveHandler.integration.test.ts
   let stateService: ReturnType<typeof createMockStateService>;
   ```

Key Findings:
1. VERIFIED: Mock state is used primarily in unit tests for individual handlers/resolvers
2. VERIFIED: Integration tests also use mock state in some cases
3. VERIFIED: Tests use proper typing via ReturnType<typeof createMockStateService>

This evidence suggests:
1. The mock state usage is widespread across test types
2. Both unit and integration tests depend on the mock behavior
3. The type system is aware of the mock's shape

Questions Raised:
1. Why do integration tests use mock state instead of real state?
2. Could mixing of real and mock states in integration tests cause issues?
3. Are there patterns in which tests fail vs succeed with mock states?

### Next Actions

1. Examine test patterns:
   - Which tests pass with mock state
   - Which tests fail with mock state
   - Whether failures correlate with state cloning

2. Review integration tests:
   - How they mix real and mock services
   - Where state transitions occur
   - Points where mock state interfaces with real services

3. Map service interactions:
   - Direct vs indirect state service usage
   - Clone operation flows
   - State transition boundaries

### 20. Real State Service Usage Patterns

VERIFIED: The real StateService is used in several key places:

1. **Entry Points**:
   ```typescript
   // bin/meld.ts
   const stateService = new StateService();

   // api/index.ts
   const state = new StateService();

   // cli/index.ts
   const stateService = new StateService();
   ```

2. **Core Implementation**:
   ```typescript
   // StateService.ts
   const child = new StateService(this);
   const cloned = new StateService();
   ```

3. **Test Context**:
   ```typescript
   // TestContext.ts
   const state = new StateService();
   state.setCurrentFilePath('test.meld');
   state.enableTransformation(true);
   ```

Key Findings:
1. VERIFIED: Real state is used at application entry points
2. VERIFIED: Real state is used for child and clone operations in the service itself
3. VERIFIED: TestContext uses real state for setup

This evidence suggests:
1. The application core relies on real state behavior
2. The real StateService implements proper cloning
3. TestContext is designed to use real state, but some tests override with mocks

Questions Raised:
1. Why do some tests bypass TestContext's real state?
2. Could the real state's clone behavior differ from what tests expect?
3. Is there a mismatch between application and test expectations?

### Next Actions

1. Compare implementations:
   - Real state clone() vs mock state clone()
   - Child state creation patterns
   - State transition behaviors

2. Analyze test boundaries:
   - Where real state meets mock state
   - How TestContext state is used/overridden
   - State service initialization chains

3. Document state lifecycle:
   - Creation points (real vs mock)
   - Transformation points
   - Service interaction points

### 21. Real State Service Clone Implementation

VERIFIED: The real StateService has a complete clone implementation:

```typescript
// StateService.ts
clone(): IStateService {
  const cloned = new StateService();

  // Create a completely new state without parent reference
  cloned.currentState = this.stateFactory.createState({
    source: 'clone',
    filePath: this.currentState.filePath
  });

  // Copy all state
  cloned.updateState({
    variables: {
      text: new Map(this.currentState.variables.text),
      data: new Map(this.currentState.variables.data),
      path: new Map(this.currentState.variables.path)
    },
    commands: new Map(this.currentState.commands),
    nodes: [...this.currentState.nodes],
    transformedNodes: this.currentState.transformedNodes ? [...this.currentState.transformedNodes] : undefined,
    imports: new Set(this.currentState.imports)
  }, 'clone');

  // Copy flags
  cloned._isImmutable = this._isImmutable;
  cloned._transformationEnabled = this._transformationEnabled;

  return cloned;
}
```

Key Findings:
1. VERIFIED: The real service properly implements clone()
2. VERIFIED: Clone creates a new state without parent reference
3. VERIFIED: All state is deeply copied including:
   - Variables (text, data, path)
   - Commands
   - Nodes and transformed nodes
   - Imports
   - Flags (_isImmutable, _transformationEnabled)

This evidence suggests:
1. The clone() implementation is complete and correct
2. The mock state's clone() differs significantly
3. The failing tests are likely using mock states

Questions Raised:
1. Why do tests fail with "clone is not a function" if it exists?
2. Are we accidentally mixing mock and real states?
3. Could type casting in mocks hide interface mismatches?

### Next Actions

1. Track state object flow:
   - From TestContext through service initialization
   - Through clone operations
   - Between different services

2. Audit mock usage:
   - Where mocks are created
   - How they're passed between services
   - Points where they interface with real services

3. Review type safety:
   - Type casting locations
   - Interface verification points
   - Service boundaries

### 22. Test Context State Service Initialization

VERIFIED: The TestContext initializes services in a specific order:

```typescript
// TestContext.ts constructor
// Initialize services
const pathOps = new PathOperationsService();
const filesystem = new FileSystemService(pathOps, this.fs);
const validation = new ValidationService();
const state = new StateService();
state.setCurrentFilePath('test.meld');
state.enableTransformation(true);

// ... initialize other services ...

// Initialize directive service
const directive = new DirectiveService();
directive.initialize(
  validation,
  state,  // Real state service passed here
  path,
  filesystem,
  parser,
  interpreter,
  circularity,
  resolution
);

// Initialize interpreter service
interpreter.initialize(directive, state);  // Real state passed here too

// Expose services
this.services = {
  parser,
  interpreter,
  directive,
  validation,
  state,  // Real state exposed here
  path,
  circularity,
  resolution,
  filesystem,
  output
};
```

Key Findings:
1. VERIFIED: TestContext creates a real StateService
2. VERIFIED: The state is properly initialized with:
   - Current file path set
   - Transformation enabled
3. VERIFIED: The same state instance is:
   - Passed to DirectiveService
   - Passed to InterpreterService
   - Exposed via this.services.state

This evidence suggests:
1. TestContext is designed to use real state
2. The state is properly initialized
3. Services are wired together correctly

Questions Raised:
1. Why do some tests bypass this real state?
2. How are mock states getting into the service chain?
3. Could service initialization order affect state type?

### Next Actions

1. Trace service initialization:
   - How services are created in tests
   - Where state services are replaced
   - Service dependency chains

2. Compare test patterns:
   - Tests using TestContext
   - Tests creating own services
   - Tests mixing real/mock services

3. Review service interfaces:
   - How services accept state
   - Where state type is checked
   - Service initialization requirements

### 23. API Test Setup and State Usage

VERIFIED: The API tests use TestContext in a specific way:

```typescript
// api/api.test.ts
describe('SDK Integration Tests', () => {
  let context: TestContext;
  let testFilePath: string;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    context = new TestContext();
    await context.initialize();
    testFilePath = 'test.meld';
  });

  it('should handle execution directives correctly', async () => {
    await context.fs.writeFile(testFilePath, '@run [echo test]');
    const result = await main(testFilePath, {
      fs: context.fs,
      services: context.services  // Passes real state from context
    });
    expect(result).toContain('[run directive output placeholder]');
  });
});
```

Key Findings:
1. VERIFIED: API tests create a fresh TestContext for each test
2. VERIFIED: Tests pass context.services to main(), which includes:
   - The real state service
   - All properly initialized services
3. VERIFIED: The failing tests all follow this pattern:
   ```typescript
   const result = await main(testFilePath, {
     fs: context.fs,
     services: context.services
   });
   ```

This evidence suggests:
1. The test setup is correct
2. Real services are being passed to main()
3. The state corruption must happen inside main()

Questions Raised:
1. What happens to the state service inside main()?
2. Could main() be creating new services?
3. Is the state being replaced somewhere in the service chain?

### Next Actions

1. Examine main() implementation:
   - How it uses the passed services
   - Whether it creates new services
   - Service initialization order

2. Trace state service usage:
   - From TestContext creation
   - Through main() execution
   - To the point of clone() failure

3. Review service dependencies:
   - How main() manages services
   - Service creation/initialization patterns
   - Points where state might be replaced

### 24. Main Function Service Handling

VERIFIED: The main() function handles services in two ways:

1. **With Test Services**:
   ```typescript
   if (options.services) {
     const { parser, interpreter, directive, validation, state, path, circularity, resolution, output } = options.services;

     // Initialize services with test context state
     directive.initialize(
       validation,
       state,  // Test context state passed here
       path,
       filesystem,
       parser,
       interpreter,
       circularity,
       resolution
     );
     interpreter.initialize(directive, state);  // And here

     // Use state in interpretation
     const resultState = await interpreter.interpret(ast, {
       filePath,
       initialState: state  // And here
     });
   }
   ```

2. **Without Test Services**:
   ```typescript
   // Create new services
   const state = new StateService();
   const directives = new DirectiveService();
   // ... other services ...

   // Initialize services with new state
   directives.initialize(
     validation,
     state,  // New state passed here
     path,
     filesystem,
     parser,
     interpreter,
     circularity,
     resolution
   );
   interpreter.initialize(directives, state);  // And here

   // Use state in interpretation
   const resultState = await interpreter.interpret(ast, {
     filePath,
     initialState: state  // And here
   });
   ```

Key Findings:
1. VERIFIED: main() preserves test services when provided
2. VERIFIED: The same state instance is used throughout:
   - In directive service initialization
   - In interpreter service initialization
   - As initial state for interpretation
3. VERIFIED: Service initialization is identical in both paths

This evidence suggests:
1. The state service is not being replaced
2. Service initialization is consistent
3. The state corruption must happen during interpretation

Questions Raised:
1. Could interpreter.interpret() be creating a new state?
2. Is the state being cloned during interpretation?
3. Could directive handlers be creating mock states?

### Next Actions

1. Examine interpreter.interpret():
   - How it handles the initial state
   - Where cloning occurs
   - State transformation points

2. Review directive handlers:
   - How they handle state
   - Where they might create new states
   - Mock state usage patterns

3. Trace state flow:
   - Through service initialization
   - During interpretation
   - In directive processing

### 25. Interpreter Service State Handling

VERIFIED: The InterpreterService has extensive state management:

1. **State Initialization**:
```typescript
async interpret(nodes: MeldNode[], options?: InterpreterOptions): Promise<IStateService> {
  // Initialize state
  if (opts.initialState) {
    if (opts.mergeState) {
      // When mergeState is true, create child state from initial state
      currentState = opts.initialState.createChildState();
    } else {
      // When mergeState is false, create completely isolated state
      currentState = this.stateService!.createChildState();
    }
  } else {
    // No initial state, create fresh state
    currentState = this.stateService!.createChildState();
  }

  // Take snapshot for rollback
  const initialSnapshot = currentState.clone();
  let lastGoodState = initialSnapshot;
}
```

2. **Node Level State Management**:
```typescript
async interpretNode(node: MeldNode, state: IStateService): Promise<IStateService> {
  // Take snapshot before processing
  const preNodeState = state.clone();
  let currentState = preNodeState;

  switch (node.type) {
    case 'Text':
      const textState = currentState.clone();
      textState.addNode(node);
      currentState = textState;
      break;

    case 'Directive':
      const directiveState = currentState.clone();
      directiveState.addNode(node);
      currentState = await this.directiveService.processDirective(directiveNode, {
        state: directiveState,
        currentFilePath: state.getCurrentFilePath() ?? undefined
      });
      break;
  }

  return currentState;
}
```

3. **Error Recovery**:
```typescript
try {
  const updatedState = await this.interpretNode(node, currentState);
  currentState = updatedState;
  lastGoodState = currentState.clone();
} catch (error) {
  // Roll back to last good state
  currentState = lastGoodState.clone();
  throw new MeldInterpreterError(...);
}
```

Key Findings:
1. VERIFIED: Multiple clone points:
   - Initial snapshot: `currentState.clone()`
   - Pre-node processing: `preNodeState = state.clone()`
   - Node type handling: `textState = currentState.clone()`
   - Error recovery: `lastGoodState = currentState.clone()`

2. VERIFIED: State creation patterns:
   ```typescript
   // From initial state
   currentState = opts.initialState.createChildState();

   // From service
   currentState = this.stateService!.createChildState();

   // From parent
   const childState = parentState.createChildState();
   ```

3. VERIFIED: State flow:
   - Initial state -> Child state
   - Child state -> Node processing
   - Node state -> Error recovery
   - Final state -> Parent merge

Root Cause Chain:
1. Interpreter gets initial state from options
2. Creates child state for processing
3. Clones state multiple times
4. If ANY state is a mock, ALL clones will be mocks

Questions Raised:
1. Could the initial state be a mock?
2. Is state type checked before cloning?
3. Are all state creation points using valid services?

Next Actions:
1. Add state validation:
   ```typescript
   private validateState(state: IStateService, context: string): void {
     if (!(state instanceof StateService)) {
       throw new MeldInterpreterError(
         `Invalid state type in ${context}`,
         'state_validation'
       );
     }
   }
   ```

2. Track state lineage:
   ```typescript
   interface StateMetadata {
     source: 'initial' | 'clone' | 'child';
     operation: string;
     parent?: StateMetadata;
   }
   ```

3. Ensure consistent state types:
   - Validate initial state
   - Check state before cloning
   - Verify state after creation

### 26. State Service Implementation

VERIFIED: The StateService has a complete implementation:

1. **Core State Management**:
```typescript
export class StateService implements IStateService {
  private stateFactory: StateFactory;
  private currentState: StateNode;
  private _isImmutable: boolean = false;
  private _transformationEnabled: boolean = false;

  constructor(parentState?: IStateService) {
    this.stateFactory = new StateFactory();
    this.currentState = this.stateFactory.createState({
      source: 'constructor',
      parentState: parentState ? (parentState as StateService).currentState : undefined
    });
  }
}
```

2. **Clone Implementation**:
```typescript
clone(): IStateService {
  const cloned = new StateService();

  // Create a completely new state without parent reference
  cloned.currentState = this.stateFactory.createState({
    source: 'clone',
    filePath: this.currentState.filePath
  });

  // Copy all state
  cloned.updateState({
    variables: {
      text: new Map(this.currentState.variables.text),
      data: new Map(this.currentState.variables.data),
      path: new Map(this.currentState.variables.path)
    },
    commands: new Map(this.currentState.commands),
    nodes: [...this.currentState.nodes],
    transformedNodes: this.currentState.transformedNodes ? [...this.currentState.transformedNodes] : undefined,
    imports: new Set(this.currentState.imports)
  }, 'clone');

  // Copy flags
  cloned._isImmutable = this._isImmutable;
  cloned._transformationEnabled = this._transformationEnabled;

  return cloned;
}
```

3. **Child State Creation**:
```typescript
createChildState(): IStateService {
  const child = new StateService(this);
  logger.debug('Created child state', {
    parentPath: this.getCurrentFilePath(),
    childPath: child.getCurrentFilePath()
  });
  return child;
}
```

Key Findings:
1. VERIFIED: The real StateService properly implements:
   - State creation and initialization
   - Deep cloning of all state
   - Child state creation with parent reference
   - State merging and updates

2. VERIFIED: Type safety is maintained:
   ```typescript
   // Only casts known types
   const child = childState as StateService;

   // Proper interface implementation
   export class StateService implements IStateService {
     // All interface methods implemented
   }
   ```

3. VERIFIED: State operations are immutable:
   ```typescript
   private updateState(updates: Partial<StateNode>, source: string): void {
     // Creates new state node
     this.currentState = this.stateFactory.updateState(this.currentState, updates);
   }
   ```

Root Cause Analysis:
1. The real StateService works correctly
2. Mock states don't properly implement the interface
3. Type casting in mocks bypasses type checks
4. Mock clone() creates more invalid mocks

Questions Raised:
1. Why are tests using mock states when the real one works?
2. Could we use the real service in tests?
3. Should we prevent type casting in mocks?

Next Actions:
1. Create proper mock class:
   ```typescript
   class MockStateService extends StateService {
     // Extend real service for proper implementation
     // Override only necessary methods
     // No type casting needed
   }
   ```

2. Add runtime type checks:
   ```typescript
   // In DirectiveService.ts:
   private ensureValidState(state: IStateService): void {
     if (typeof state.clone !== 'function') {
       throw new Error('Invalid state service: missing clone() method');
     }
   }
   ```

3. Update test factories:
   ```typescript
   export function createTestStateService(): IStateService {
     // Use real service with test configuration
     const state = new StateService();
     state.setCurrentFilePath('test.meld');
     state.enableTransformation(true);
     return state;
   }
   ```

### 32. State Factory Implementation

VERIFIED: The StateFactory manages state creation and updates:

1. **State Creation**:
```typescript
createState(options?: StateNodeOptions): StateNode {
  const state: StateNode = {
    variables: {
      text: new Map(options?.parentState?.variables.text ?? []),
      data: new Map(options?.parentState?.variables.data ?? []),
      path: new Map(options?.parentState?.variables.path ?? [])
    },
    commands: new Map(options?.parentState?.commands ?? []),
    imports: new Set(options?.parentState?.imports ?? []),
    nodes: [...(options?.parentState?.nodes ?? [])],
    transformedNodes: options?.parentState?.transformedNodes ? [...options.parentState.transformedNodes] : undefined,
    filePath: options?.filePath ?? options?.parentState?.filePath,
    parentState: options?.parentState
  };
  return state;
}
```

2. **State Merging**:
```typescript
mergeStates(parent: StateNode, child: StateNode): StateNode {
  // Create new maps with parent values as base
  const text = new Map(parent.variables.text);
  const data = new Map(parent.variables.data);
  const path = new Map(parent.variables.path);
  const commands = new Map(parent.commands);

  // Merge child variables - last write wins
  for (const [key, value] of child.variables.text) {
    text.set(key, value);
  }
  // ... merge other maps ...

  return {
    variables: { text, data, path },
    commands,
    imports: new Set([...parent.imports, ...child.imports]),
    nodes: [...parent.nodes, ...child.nodes],
    transformedNodes: child.transformedNodes ?? parent.transformedNodes,
    filePath: child.filePath ?? parent.filePath,
    parentState: parent.parentState
  };
}
```

3. **State Updates**:
```typescript
updateState(state: StateNode, updates: Partial<StateNode>): StateNode {
  const updated: StateNode = {
    variables: {
      text: updates.variables?.text ?? new Map(state.variables.text),
      data: updates.variables?.data ?? new Map(state.variables.data),
      path: updates.variables?.path ?? new Map(state.variables.path)
    },
    commands: updates.commands ?? new Map(state.commands),
    imports: new Set(updates.imports ?? state.imports),
    nodes: [...(updates.nodes ?? state.nodes)],
    transformedNodes: updates.transformedNodes !== undefined ? [...updates.transformedNodes] : state.transformedNodes,
    filePath: updates.filePath ?? state.filePath,
    parentState: updates.parentState ?? state.parentState
  };
  return updated;
}
```

Key Findings:
1. VERIFIED: All state operations are immutable:
   - New maps created for all collections
   - Arrays are spread into new arrays
   - No direct mutation of state

2. VERIFIED: State inheritance is preserved:
   ```typescript
   // In createState:
   parentState: options?.parentState

   // In mergeStates:
   parentState: parent.parentState

   // In updateState:
   parentState: updates.parentState ?? state.parentState
   ```

3. VERIFIED: Operation logging:
   ```typescript
   private logOperation(operation: StateOperation): void {
     this.operations.push(operation);
     logger.debug('State operation', operation);
   }
   ```

Root Cause Analysis:
1. The state factory creates valid state nodes
2. Mock states don't use the factory
3. Mock states lack proper structure
4. Mock clones don't preserve state

Questions Raised:
1. Could mocks use the real factory?
2. Should we validate state structure?
3. Are all state properties being copied?

Next Actions:
1. Create factory validator:
   ```typescript
   function validateStateNode(state: unknown): asserts state is StateNode {
     if (!state || typeof state !== 'object') {
       throw new Error('Invalid state node');
     }
     if (!('variables' in state) || !state.variables) {
       throw new Error('Missing variables in state');
     }
     // ... validate other properties ...
   }
   ```

2. Use factory in mocks:
   ```typescript
   class MockStateService extends StateService {
     private factory = new StateFactory();

     clone(): IStateService {
       // Use real factory for proper state structure
       const cloned = new MockStateService();
       cloned.currentState = this.factory.createState({
         source: 'mock-clone'
       });
       return cloned;
     }
   }
   ```

3. Add state structure checks:
   ```typescript
   interface StateStructure {
     readonly variables: {
       readonly text: Map<string, string>;
       readonly data: Map<string, unknown>;
       readonly path: Map<string, string>;
     };
     readonly commands: Map<string, CommandDefinition>;
     readonly imports: Set<string>;
     readonly nodes: ReadonlyArray<MeldNode>;
     readonly transformedNodes?: ReadonlyArray<MeldNode>;
     readonly filePath?: string;
     readonly parentState?: StateNode;
   }
   ```

// ... existing code ...

\======= END AUDIT WORK COMPLETED

\======= TASK

Provide feedback on the information gathered thus far, its validity, and value.

Advise on how we should proceed with your original plan based on this new information.

</User>

<Assistant message_number="1">

YOU THEN RESPONDED WITH THIS:

Below is an organized review of the “audit” materials you provided (“ATTEMPT 1 part a/b/c” and “ATTEMPT 2”), along with insights on their validity, potential pitfalls, and how they might (or might not) advance the original phased plan. Finally, I include a recommendation on how to proceed—particularly with “Phase 1: Audit & Alignment” and beyond—given the new observations that the audits might include incorrect or conflated details.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) OVERALL FEEDBACK ON THE AUDIT CONTENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1.1) Positive Aspects & Potentially Useful Points

• The audits do show consistent awareness of the central problem that “mock” StateService implementations differ from the real one, especially regarding transformation and clone() behaviors.  
• The text highlights repeated references to the mismatch between partial or legacy mocks and the real StateService. That is indeed a known risk that often causes “clone is not a function” or “missing method” errors in test environments.  
• There is repeated emphasis on verifying that transformation mode is fully supported in both the real StateService and in any mocks. That is a legitimate angle to explore.  
• Some of the audit references, like “DirectiveService not incorporating node replacements properly” or “InterpreterService always adding original directive nodes even in transformation mode,” can be legitimate concerns to review. These two points (discarded replacements and always-adding original nodes) do come up in large directive-based codebases.

All this suggests that the direction of the audits (i.e., focusing on the mismatch between real vs. mocked services, investigating whether directive transformations are being lost, etc.) is aligned with the typical fail points in DSL interpreters.

1.2) Potential Invalid or “Context Drunk” Elements

• The audits occasionally cite code fragments that might not match your real code—for instance, references to “logger.debug('State operation', operation)” or certain “StateFactory.ts” method signatures that may or may not exist in your actual repo. Some of these expansions appear plausible but are not guaranteed to reflect your real classes or function names (the code may be partially hallucinated or conflated with typical patterns from other codebases).  
• Some audits claim that “we found 7 failing tests in these exact files with these line references,” but your real codebase might not have matching line numbers or error messages. If you do not actually see these exact names or line references, those details can be spurious.  
• The repeated mention of “Legacy InterpreterState mock” or “InterpreterState class in tests/mocks/state.ts” suggests a very particular setup that might or might not exist in your actual code. It is possible the audits conflate an older concept or something from a partial snippet you provided with a guess about your repo’s structure.  
• Certain file references (e.g., “attempting merges of parent and child states,” “validateParentReference,” etc.) could be purely hypothetical expansions. They may be describing general best practices or a theoretical approach, not definitely real code in your codebase.

Hence, while the overarching narrative (mismatch between the real service and test mocks) is a well-known problem, you should treat specific file line references, code listings, or method names from these “audit texts” with caution.

1.3) Value of the Materials Overall

• The broad strokes align with typical root causes for many Meld-like DSL test breakages (e.g., “clone is not a function”).  
• The repeated recommendations to unify or fix mocks so they match the real interface are valuable.  
• The expansions on “DirectiveService discarding replacement nodes” vs. “InterpreterService forcibly adding original nodes” might be worth verifying in your code.  
• The impetus to systematically check each interface method in real vs. mock implementations is clearly correct—and resonates with the original plan’s “Phase 1: Audit & Alignment.”  

In short, these audits (despite some possibly “hallucinated” details) do pivot around the real issue: partial mock or stub classes cause breakage. They also push you to unify the transformations of directives so that the final output can strip or replace them. Those are exactly the sorts of tasks your multi-phase plan was meant to solve in a controlled, stepwise manner.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2) ADVICE ON INCORPORATING THESE AUDITS INTO YOUR PHASED PLAN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Given that the audits mix valid issues with uncertain or invented details, here is how you can still leverage them in your original plan:

2.1) Phase 1: “Audit & Alignment”  
• Perform your own real “interface vs. implementation” check. That means literally opening up “IStateService.ts” (or whichever file defines it), listing each method (with exact signatures) in a spreadsheet or table, and verifying whether each real class that claims to implement IStateService (including mocks) truly implements every method.  
• Similarly, confirm that any function that references state.clone() or state.enableTransformation() is indeed using an object or mock that has those methods, with the correct signature and return types.  
• In other words, do exactly what the original plan says but treat the “attempts” from the LLM as rough pointers: it’s correct that you might have multiple partial mocks, or “legacy” mocks. Check them. See whether they truly do or do not appear in your code. Document your real findings.

2.2) Phase 2: “Evidence Collection”  
• Some of the code in the audits showing how to create minimal tests for clone() or transformation might be partially on the mark. For instance, you can still create a “StateService.clone.test.ts” or a “TransformationMode.test.ts” to see if your real code behaves as expected in isolation.  
• If you spot references to specific “missing methods” or “lost transformations,” adapt or rewrite those references into real verifying tests that precisely match your code. If your code has, for example, “StateService.cloneChildren” or “StateService.createChildState” and you suspect it’s not tested, you can adapt the LLM’s test approach or keep the same style.  
• Refrain from blindly copying the LLM’s code listings into your test files. Instead, glean the structure or logic (“test that a cloned state has identical transformation flags and node arrays”) and then re-implement it to match your real code.

2.3) Phase 3: “Instrument Failing Integration Tests”  
• The audits are correct that instrumentation (logging or console statements) will help you confirm if the StateService instance is a partial mock. For example, log something like console.log("StateService has clone?:", typeof state.clone) in the failing tests to see if you are indeed dealing with a real or partial service.  
• This step helps you gather real evidence. If you see that you actually never have a partial mock in your integration test logs, then the audits’ suspicion about partial mocks may not apply. Conversely, if you discover that “somewhere,” a test factory is injecting an incomplete mock, then you have your direct evidence.

2.4) Phase 4 and Onward  
• The multi-phase approach you established remains sound. Even if the community or LLM-based attempts appear “context drunk,” the best route is still to fix the interface alignment (Phase 1), build small targeted tests (Phase 2), add instrumentation to the failing big tests (Phase 3), and systematically unify the test code so it uses a consistent, production-like setup (Phase 4).  
• The final phases (5–6) about clarifying directive transformation rules and cleaning up leftover approvals also remain the best practice for ensuring no contradictory test scenarios (some tests expecting directives to remain, others expecting them removed).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3) HOW TO PROCEED—BECOMING “LLM-RESISTANT”
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Given that you suspect the auditing attempts are mixing real code with invented or conflated examples, here are some process suggestions:

3.1) Refine Your Evidence-Gathering  
• Instead of trusting the audits’ code references, do an in-editor “grep” or “find all references” for each mention (e.g., search your entire codebase for something like “export class InterpreterState” or “tests/mocks/state”). If you can’t locate them, the LLM’s references are likely invented.  
• Where the audits mention a “legacy mock,” search for terms like “mockState” or “InterpreterState.” If they do not exist, you can disregard that chunk of the audit.

3.2) Conduct a Real Service vs. Mock Survey  
• For each mock or test factory in your code, confirm method by method that it does or does not match the real service interface. Build a short table (maybe 10–15 rows, each row for one method: clone, enableTransformation, getTransformedNodes, etc.).  
• If you see any mismatch (like the mock has no transformNode method but the real interface does), fix it or remove that mock usage.  
• This lines up exactly with your Phase 1 goal. The difference is that you’re doing it with direct code references, not the generically invented code from the LLM outputs.

3.3) Reuse the Audit’s Themes—But Validate Each One  
For instance, the audits repeatedly mention “discarded directive replacements” and “code that always adds the original node.” That might be relevant to Meld if you are noticing that your final output still shows the raw directive. So check:  
• In InterpreterService or DirectiveService, do you see logic that’s supposed to store the “replacement node” in transformedNodes, but maybe it never gets called?  
• If your code does handle replacement, verify with logs or breakpoints that it’s actually happening.

3.4) Incrementally Clarify the Directive Transformation Rules  
• Phases 5 and 6 in your plan revolve around consistent rules for which directives remain in the final output. Possibly incorporate a short summary in your docs: “In transformation mode, we remove most directives from the final output. If a directive has textual or code expansions, we add those expansions as new text nodes or code nodes. If it has no expansions, we remove it.”  
• Write integration tests that confirm exactly that behavior. This locks down the confusion about partial directive transformations.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4) CONCLUSION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The “audit” documents you shared do reflect many typical truths about DSL code and test environments—especially around partial mocks and missing methods. However, they also contain context that may not map perfectly onto your real codebase (incorrect line references, extra classes you don’t have, invented method names).

Nevertheless, you can extract real value by:

• Using the audits’ broad conclusions (that partial mocks are likely an issue; that directive transformation might be losing replacements; that you need consistent transformation mode testing) to guide your Phase 1–4 steps.  
• Verifying each purported code snippet or claimed mismatch by direct searching in your repo.  
• Continuing with your original multi-phase plan, because it remains a robust method to systematically address the core problem.

In essence, keep the plan, but treat the LLM audit output as rough “talking points” to confirm or disprove in your real code. Then methodically correct your code and mocks, ensuring everything is consistent with IStateService and transformation logic. Once you unify the “real vs. mock” state usage (and confirm all directive transformations are properly recognized), the majority of your “clone is not a function” and “leftover directive” issues should resolve.

<User message_number="2">

I'm not really able to perform the audit myself. I'm just one person and I'm far too ADHD to complete such a thoroughly careful task without assistance. (I'm certainly a developer, but this codebase is 100% built LLMs with just my supervision and I'm typically used to working with full engineering teams that I'm more often a product manager for than even an engineering manager.)

I actually have a high degree of confidence in taking an LLM-engineering approach to this audit, but I'd like your help figuring out how best to approach it.

I think if we break the audit up into very specific pieces that are SOLELY focused on gathering / comparing specific information, we can automate LLM prompts for each task and optimize for freshest/best early context windows. This kind of thing is, in fact, the *exact* thing meld (this codebase) is designed to do and I have a protoype version of it that does that.

Here's an example -- basically a truncated version of the exact prompt script assembly I used to send you the initial message:

```meld

@import[partials/meld-architect.md]

We want to create a thoughtfully structured plan for addressing some complex issues we have encountered. We are now asking for your help preparing a detailed plan which is written in order to maximize success based on it being carried out by an LLM developer.

I am going to provide you with some context:

- Architecture documentation (slightly outdated)
- Test setup 
- Issues we encountered
- Our completed plan to fix these issues
- The subsequent test failures we encountered as we reached the point of finishing that plan
- The advice you provided for strategically approaching resolving these issues

======= CONTEXT 

=== ARCHITECTURE

@import[../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md]

=== TEST SETUP

@import[../docs/TESTS.md]

=== ISSUES ENCOUNTERED

@import[../dev/ISSUES.md]

=== COMPLETED PLAN FOR ADDRESSING ISSUES

@import[../dev/PLAN.md]

=== SUBSEQUENT ISSUES ENCOUNTERED

@import[../dev/TESTFAILS.md]

=== YOUR ADVICE (VERY IMPORTANT CONTEXT)

@import[test-answer-6.md]

======= END CONTEXT 

======= YOUR TASK

```

And I can also add in a command running a tool called `cpai` which concatenates files / folders of code for sending in LLM prompts (ie `@cmd[cpai services tests --stdout]`) or add a line invoking `@cmd[npm test]` to send the test results.

Do you have any suggestions about how we might go about approaching the audit in this way rather than me having to pore over a spreadsheet? 🙏 😘

Let's experiment a little :)
