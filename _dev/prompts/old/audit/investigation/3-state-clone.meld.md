# StateService Clone Analysis

@import[partials/header.md]
@import[partials/code-analysis-instructions.md]

## CODE TO ANALYZE

=== STATE SERVICE IMPLEMENTATION ===

@cmd[cpai ../../services/StateService/StateService.ts --stdout]

=== CLONE USAGE IN TESTS ===

@cmd[cpai ../../tests/services/StateService/StateService.test.ts --stdout]

=== CLONE USAGE IN PRODUCTION ===

@cmd[cpai ../../services/DirectiveService/handlers/*.ts ../../services/OutputService/OutputService.ts --stdout]

=== FAILING TESTS ===

@cmd[npm test tests/api/api.test.ts tests/services/OutputService/OutputService.test.ts ; echo "Test execution complete"]

## YOUR TASK

Perform a thorough analysis of StateService's clone() implementation and usage:

1. Analyze clone() implementation:
   - Document exact clone() method signature
   - List all fields that should be cloned
   - Check deep vs shallow copying
   - Note any transformation state handling

2. Review clone() test coverage:
   - Find all direct clone() test cases
   - Check what state is verified after cloning
   - Note any missing test scenarios
   - Flag any assumptions about clone behavior

3. Map production clone() usage:
   - List all places clone() is called
   - Document the state before/after clone
   - Note any error handling around clone
   - Check transformation mode interaction

@import[partials/quality-requirements.md]

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:

- Create a clone() behavior matrix
- Document all clone() call sites
- Note any array/object copying issues
- Flag any circular reference handling
- List transformation state copying
- Map clone() to test failures
