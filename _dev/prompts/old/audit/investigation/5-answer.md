--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 1. FAILURE ANALYSIS MATRIX

Below is a summary table mapping the reported errors to the relevant test file, the visible error message, and the approximate location in the code where the error originates.

| Test / File (Reported in Logs)                                                                            | Error Message                                                                                                                | Relevant Code (Approx.)                                              | Observations                                                                                                                         |

| RunDirectiveHandler.transformation.test.ts <br> (“transformation behavior”)                                                                      | Error executing run directive: Command failed                                                                                | RunDirectiveHandler (not fully shown) <br> Called from processDirective() <br> Lines ~297–327 in DirectiveService.ts | • The test logs show the directive fails due to an invalid or failing command. <br> • The error is propagated by the directive handler and caught in the test as expected. |
| RunDirectiveHandler.test.ts <br> (“error handling”)                                                                                              | Directive error (run): Invalid command <br> Directive error (run): Variable not found <br> Command failed                    | Same location as above (DirectiveService.ts) <br> The specific “run” handler is executed after validation                                | • The logs show multiple scenario-based errors: invalid command, missing variable, or a command exception. <br> • Appears to validate that error paths work properly.       |
| ImportDirectiveHandler.test.ts <br> (“basic importing” / “error handling” / “cleanup”)                                                           | Directive error (import): Import file not found <br> Directive error (import): Invalid import <br> Circular import detected  | DirectiveService.ts <br> handleImportDirective() <br> Lines 156–159, 186–187                     | • Includes tests for nonexistent files, invalid syntax, and circular imports. <br> • All cases trigger an error in handleImportDirective() and are rethrown as expected.    |

NOTES:
• Despite the log lines marked with [error], the final test summary shows all tests “passed” or were “skipped/ todo.” Many of these appear to be negative tests that intentionally trigger and verify error handling.  
• No explicit “OutputService” failures appear in the snippet. The logs do not show a failing test specifically named “OutputService.test.ts.”  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2. API TEST FAILURES

This section details the API-level tests that triggered errors in the logs (largely involving “ImportDirectiveHandler,” “RunDirectiveHandler,” and other directive handlers). While the final summary indicates these tests passed, each test logs an error that appears intentional. Below are key findings.

### 2.1 Documented Error Messages

The primary error messages seen in the logs:

1. "Directive error (import): Import file not found: [missing.meld]"  
2. "Directive error (run): Invalid command"  
3. "Directive error (import): Circular import detected"  
4. "Error executing run directive: Command failed"  

These messages all originate from directive handling code that checks file existence, command validity, or recursion detection.

### 2.2 Execution Path to Failure

• For “ImportDirectiveHandler,” failures are thrown at:
  - Lines 156–159 in DirectiveService.ts (snippet reference), within:
    ┌ (line 156)  if (!await this.fileSystemService!.exists(fullPath)) {
    └ (line 157)    throw new Error(`Import file not found: ${fullPath}`);

  - Then re-caught and wrapped in a MeldDirectiveError at lines 186–187.

• For “RunDirectiveHandler,” failures are triggered in the execution logic (e.g., invalid command or command failure), then forwarded through DirectiveService’s processDirective(...) around lines 297–327.

### 2.3 Mock Service Usage

• The code frequently references (this.fileSystemService!.exists) or (this.pathService!.resolvePath). Tests mocking these services could be returning false to ensure the directive code raises “file not found” errors.  
• No direct evidence of mock inconsistencies is visible in the logs themselves (the logs do not list changed mocks at runtime), but the repeated “file not found” suggests a forced negative test path.

### 2.4 State Management Flow

• In ImportDirectiveHandler (DirectiveService.ts lines ~222–225), the code calls createChildState() before parsing/ interpreting the imported file:  
  ┌ (line 222)  const childState = await this.stateService!.createChildState();  
  This child state merges back into the parent if no error occurs.  
• Errors short-circuit the merge by throwing a MeldDirectiveError. The logs confirm that the error is caught and logged, which is apparently expected in negative test cases.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 3. OUTPUTSERVICE FAILURES

From the provided logs, there are no explicit errors referencing OutputService methods (e.g., convertToMarkdown, convertToLLMXML, etc.):

• The test command invoked “tests/api/api.test.ts tests/services/OutputService/OutputService.test.ts,” but the snippet does not show failing OutputService tests.  
• All transformation or directive-based errors come from DirectiveService.  

Therefore, based on the shared logs:

1. No failing transformation tests specifically mention OutputService methods.  
2. If OutputService tests failed, they are not shown in these logs.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 4. COMPARISON: FAILING VS. PASSING TESTS

Although the logs repeatedly show “error” statements, the final summary indicates all relevant test files passed or were skipped. Below are observed patterns:

| Aspect                       | Failing Tests (Logged Errors)                                                            | Passing Tests (No Errors Logged)                                                    |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Error Handling              | Tests log “Import file not found,” “Command failed,” etc. but exit successfully (✓).     | Many directive handler tests also pass silently if they do not trigger negative paths. |
| Mocks / Setup               | Negative tests likely mock file existence checks or commands to fail.                    | Passing tests either mock with valid file paths/ commands or do not rely on them.   |
| State Management            | Tests where a child state is created but the code throws expected errors (circular import, missing files). | Standard usage likely merges child states without error.                            |
| Transformation Mode         | Test logs referencing “transformation” appear to confirm that error handling is preserved (rather than break in transformed code). | Passing tests confirm normal directives also function with transformations off.     |

### 4.1 Patterns in Failures

• All reported “failures” are negative test scenarios verifying correct error handling.  
• The same directive pipeline is used (DirectiveService → [Handler].execute → throw) but with different input conditions.  
• The “mock” or “setup” difference is that these negative tests intentionally ensure a missing file, an invalid command, or an invalid directive.

### 4.2 Shared Assumptions

• That “file not found” should always raise a MeldDirectiveError(“FILE_NOT_FOUND”).  
• That “invalid command” or “variable not found” is verified by RunDirectiveHandler.  
• The existence of transformation mode does not override or skip error checks; it is still tested for correctness.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 5. KEY FINDINGS & NEXT STEPS

Below is a concise list of actionable findings based on the logs and code:

1. ▶ All Logged Errors Appear Intentional  
   • Each “error” from the logs corresponds to a negative test verifying that DirectiveService raises correct exceptions.  
   • Final test results show these are not truly failing tests; they pass by expecting these exceptions.

2. ▶ No Confirmed OutputService Failures in Logs  
   • Despite the mention of “OutputService.test.ts,” no failing test steps reference OutputService code or transformations.  
   • If there are OutputService issues, they are not shown in the snippet’s logs.

3. ▶ State Management Observations  
   • DirectiveService calls createChildState() (DirectiveService.ts around line 222) and may merge or discard it on error. This behavior is consistent with an immutable or partial-merge approach from StateService.  
   • No direct evidence of a mismatch in the logs; all negative tests confirm the expected short-circuit on error.

4. ▶ Potential Areas for Future Investigation  
   • Validate whether the same negative tests exist for OutputService transformations (e.g., calling convert with an invalid format).  
   • Confirm that partial merges for child states are tested under multiple transformations and that no leftover or partial merges occur.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 6. RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

1. Double-check OutputService Tests  
   • If there are known issues, ensure logs are captured or that the tests are not silently skipped.  
   • Verify transformation mode in OutputService by testing “isTransformationEnabled()” usage (OutputService.ts, lines ~50–59).

2. Confirm All Negative Test Flows for Directives  
   • The logs show repeated “file not found” or “command failed” errors. Ensure no duplication of negative test coverage.  
   • Confirm consistent mocking of file existence and command success/failure.

3. Review Child-State Merges in Edge Cases  
   • Because each failing example uses a throw before merging, confirm that no partial merges occur.  
   • Add logs or assertions confirming the final parent state remains unchanged on error.
