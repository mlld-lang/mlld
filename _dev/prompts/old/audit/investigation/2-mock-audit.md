# Mock Services Audit

# Meld Codebase Audit

This is part of a systematic audit of the Meld codebase, focusing on transformation issues, state management bugs, and service implementation mismatches.

## FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS

- Use markdown tables for comparisons
- Use code blocks with language tags
- Include line numbers for all code references
- Format method signatures consistently
- Separate sections with clear headers
- Include evidence for all findings

## ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS

- Base all findings on concrete evidence from the code
- Do not make assumptions without supporting code
- Highlight any contradictions found
- Note any missing or incomplete implementations
- Identify patterns across multiple files
- Flag any potential architectural issues  ## CODE ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS

1. INTERFACE ANALYSIS
   - Check method signatures match exactly
   - Verify parameter types and return types
   - Confirm optional parameters are consistent
   - Note any documentation mismatches

2. IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS
   - Verify all interface methods are implemented
   - Check for extra methods not in interface
   - Confirm implementation behavior matches docs
   - Note any partial or incomplete implementations

3. MOCK ANALYSIS
   - Compare mock methods to real implementations
   - Check mock return types match interface
   - Verify mock behavior in test scenarios
   - Note any missing or incomplete mock methods

4. TEST COVERAGE
   - Check which methods are actually tested
   - Note any untested code paths
   - Verify test assertions match requirements
   - Flag any inconsistent test behavior

IMPORTANT: Always check both the interface definition AND its usage in the codebase. Methods may be used that aren't properly defined in the interface.

## YOUR TASK

Perform a thorough audit of all StateService mocks and their usage:

1. Create a complete mock inventory:
   - List all StateService mocks/stubs found
   - Compare each mock's methods to IStateService
   - Note any partial or incomplete implementations
   - Flag any mocks that extend vs reimplement

2. Analyze mock behavior:
   - Check clone() implementation in each mock
   - Verify transformation mode handling
   - Compare return types to interface
   - Note any simplified/stubbed behavior

3. Map mock usage in failing tests:
   - Find which mocks are used in failing tests
   - Note how mocks are constructed/injected
   - Check if mocks properly implement needed methods
   - Identify any mock behavior inconsistencies

## RESPONSE QUALITY REQUIREMENTS

1. EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS
   - Every finding must reference specific code
   - Include relevant line numbers and file paths
   - Quote critical code segments when relevant
   - Link findings to specific test failures or logs

2. STRUCTURED OUTPUT
   - Use tables for comparisons and summaries
   - Use bullet points for lists of findings
   - Use code blocks for code examples
   - Use headers to organize sections

3. ACTIONABLE RESULTS
   - Clearly state each issue found
   - Provide concrete examples of problems
   - Link issues to specific code locations
   - Suggest specific next steps or areas for investigation

DO NOT GUESS. DO NOT GIVE HAND-WAVY ADVICE. BE EVIDENCE-BASED, EXPLICIT, AND DECISIVE.

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:

- Create a mock comparison matrix
- Include exact file locations for all mocks
- Note which tests use which mocks
- Flag any transformation-related mock issues
- List all clone() implementations
- Identify any mock initialization patterns
