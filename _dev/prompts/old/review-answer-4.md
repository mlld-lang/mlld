Response:
Below is a structured analysis of the audit findings, followed by a recommended path forward that refines your existing plan (Phases 2–6). It also includes a proposal for a new “state instrumentation” layer that will help with debugging and long-term maintenance. This answer is divided into three sections:

1) Summary of Key Audit Findings  
2) Recommended Long-Term State Instrumentation Approach  
3) Next Steps, Mapped to the Original Plan  

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) SUMMARY OF KEY AUDIT FINDINGS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

From the audit data you provided, here are the most important takeaways:

1. “currentState.clone is not a function” Errors  
   • In several integration tests (API tests, full pipeline), the code attempts to call .clone() on a plain StateNode rather than on the actual StateService.  
   • This indicates either a test harness or a service method is incorrectly expecting “currentState” to behave like a full service instance. The real fix is to call stateService.clone() instead.  
   • Partial mocks can also cause this if they omit clone() or improperly return a non-service object.

2. Transformation Mode Discrepancies in Output  
   • Failing OutputService tests expect directives like @run [echo test] to be replaced with “test output.” Currently, some directives remain untransformed in transformedNodes, resulting in “echo test” in the final output.  
   • The logs show “Unexpected directive in transformed nodes” or an assertion mismatch when the test wants a replaced string. This indicates that directive handlers (e.g., RunDirectiveHandler) do not always call transformNode() to swap out the directive node.

3. Inconsistent Return Types from DirectiveService  
   • Two tests show “TypeError: result.getTextVar is not a function.” That implies the test expects a fully functional IStateService instance (or something with a getTextVar method) but instead receives a partial object (possibly just the final merged nodes, or a raw data structure).  
   • The fix likely involves ensuring DirectiveService returns—or the test requests—an actual StateService instance (or modifies the test to accept the real shape of the result).

4. Partial Mocks vs. Real Implementations  
   • The audit confirms real StateService has a thorough method set (clone, createChildState, transformNode, etc.), while many mocks do not. This leads to unimplemented or missing methods in tests that rely on them.  
   • Stage 1 of your plan has rightly aligned the interface with the real code. Now step-by-step unification of test mocks is needed.

5. Shallow Copy vs. Deep Copy in clone()  
   • The real StateService clone() does a shallow copy of arrays/maps but does not truly deep clone arbitrary object fields. This might be acceptable if most node data is read-only after creation.  
   • If tests or modules require deeper copying, you may eventually need a robust deep-clone strategy (though that’s not necessarily urgent unless you see actual collisions or shared-object problems).

2) RECOMMENDED LONG-TERM STATE INSTRUMENTATION APPROACH
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

As you move into the next phases, you have an opportunity to build a small “state instrumentation” layer. This would allow you to:

• Trace every significant change to the state (e.g., transformations, variable updates, clone operations) in a structured, consistent manner.  
• Easily debug tests by dumping or logging the exact shape of the state at key lifecycle points (e.g., after parse, after interpret, after transform).  
• Provide snapshot-based comparisons to detect unintended changes or partial transformations.

Below is a detailed outline for implementing such instrumentation:

A) Add a “StateLifecycleEvent” Emitter  
   • Within StateService, introduce a small event mechanism (e.g., an EventEmitter or an observer API).  
   • Whenever “createChildState,” “mergeChildState,” “enableTransformation,” or “transformNode” is called, emit a structured event:  
     {
       eventType: 'enableTransformation' | 'transformNode' | 'clone' | ...
       oldStateSnapshot: Partial<StateNode> | undefined
       newStateSnapshot: Partial<StateNode> | undefined
       context: string (e.g., reason or directive info)
     }  
   • If you want minimal overhead, you can store just “state deltas” instead of full snapshots.

B) Attach a Logger or Debug Writer  
   • Provide an injectable or configurable logger (e.g., a “StateInstrumentationService” or “StateLogger”) that listens for these events.  
   • By default, it might log to console.debug in dev/test, or remain silent in production (unless debug logging is enabled).  
   • For persistent debugging, you can write these events into a .json or .log file.

C) Support Unique Trace IDs for Each StateService Instance  
   • When you call createChildState() or clone(), mark the resulting new instance with a “serviceId” or an incrementing “childNumber.”  
   • This helps you differentiate logs from parent and child states. This can be crucial when debugging multiple nested imports or merges.

D) Expose Instrumentation Hooks in Tests
   • For integration tests, you might redirect instrumentation logs to a buffer or an in-memory store.  
   • On a test failure, print the last few events (the “history” of state changes) to see exactly where transformations or merges went wrong.

E) Summarize and Compare Snapshots  
   • You can integrate with your existing MemfsTestFileSystem or TestSnapshot system to store state snapshots (like an in-memory “debugState.json”).  
   • If a transformation unexpectedly modifies a variable or fails to replace a directive, you’ll see a difference in the final snapshot.  

F) Roll This Out Incrementally  
   • Start by instrumenting the clone() and transformNode() calls, since these are the biggest sources of confusion.  
   • Next, add events for key merges (mergeChildState) or transformations (enableTransformation).  
   • Over time, you can unify that instrumentation into a single “onStateChange” observer.

This approach, if done carefully, will significantly reduce detective work each time you see a test fail with “expected 'test output' but got 'echo test'.” You’ll be able to see the entire chain of transformations or to confirm that no transformNode call was triggered for that directive.

3) NEXT STEPS, MAPPED TO YOUR ORIGINAL PLAN
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You have a multi-phase roadmap (Phases 0 through 6). Having completed Phase 1’s audit/alignment, here is how to weave in the new findings and state instrumentation:

PHASE 2 (EVIDENCE COLLECTION)  
• Build the small, isolated tests for clone(), transformation mode, etc. (as originally planned).  
• Integrate initial instrumentation for a few high-value methods: clone(), transformNode(), enableTransformation(). Seeing events in these minimal tests will confirm your instrumentation works.  
• Use these small tests to verify that re-enabling transformation does not overwrite partial transformations (edit enableTransformation if needed).  
• If you discover actual test code calling “currentState.clone(),” fix it to call “someService.clone()” or rewrite the test so it uses the real service.  

PHASE 3 (INSTRUMENT FAILING INTEGRATION TESTS)  
• Now that you have partial instrumentation in place, focus on the 10 failing tests identified.  
• Enable verbose instrumentation in those failing pipeline tests, so logs reveal if the directive handlers never call transformNode() or if some partial mock is returned instead of a real service.  
• Specifically watch for variables:  
  – Are we using a partial mock that lacks clone()?  
  – Are we returning an object from DirectiveService that can’t do getTextVar()?  
• Compare the logs of a passing test with a failing test to see differences in the instrumentation events.

PHASE 4 (RESOLVE MISMATCHES AND ENSURE PRODUCTION-LIKE SETUP)  
• With instrumentation evidence, fix each mismatch:  
  1. Update test code so it never calls .clone() on a plain object.  
  2. Ensure directive handlers that produce final text do call transformNode() when transformation is on.  
  3. Replace partial mocks with full or real StateService usage in integration tests.  
• Confirm that the OutputService sees only text nodes in state.getTransformedNodes() for transformation tests.  

PHASE 5 (DIRECTIVE & OUTPUT CONSISTENCY RULES)  
• Once transformations are stable, unify how each directive is replaced or removed. If the rule is “all directives must vanish in transformation mode,” ensure every directive handler does that.  
• Use the instrumentation logs to confirm no directive nodes remain.  
• Document these final rules so test authors know: “In transformation mode, a directive either becomes text/code or gets removed entirely.”

PHASE 6 (CLEANUP & LONG-TERM MAINTENANCE)  
• Remove or scale down any excessive logs.  
• Document the instrumentation approach so new developers can see how to attach watchers or parse event logs.  
• Possibly add a lint rule or guard that partial mocks must implement every IStateService method.  
• Finalize the consistent approach to state transformations—no leftover directives, consistent “clone” usage, stable merges.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CONCLUSION
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

With the Phase 1 audit largely complete, your codebase already has a clear list of mismatches (missing clone methods, incomplete transformations, partial mocks). A small but robust “state instrumentation” layer will help your remaining phases—especially for diagnosing the repeated “echo test” vs. “test output” mismatch and ensuring you never again chase “clone is not a function” errors. As you proceed through Phases 2–4, progressively adopt or enhance the instrumentation system so you can see exactly how the state changes at each step, unify your directive transformations, and confirm the final Node arrays are directive-free. Ultimately, you will reach Phase 5–6 with a consistent, well-documented transformation flow and thoroughly tested, maintainable code.
