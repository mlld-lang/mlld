# Meld Codebase Audit

This is part of a systematic audit of the Meld codebase, focusing on transformation issues, state management bugs, and service implementation mismatches.

## FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS

- Use markdown tables for comparisons
- Use code blocks with language tags
- Include line numbers for all code references
- Format method signatures consistently
- Separate sections with clear headers
- Include evidence for all findings

## ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS

- Base all findings on concrete evidence from the code
- Do not make assumptions without supporting code
- Highlight any contradictions found
- Note any missing or incomplete implementations
- Identify patterns across multiple files
- Flag any potential architectural issues
