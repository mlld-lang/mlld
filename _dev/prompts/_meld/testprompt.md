Here's your task:

1. run the tests

2. choose 1 test or set of tests collected in _issues/_active/transformation

3. investigate and document it in _issues/_active/transformation for your selected issue(s) -- treat your doc like a science notebook and keep collecting more evidence as you learn more

4. Use the DEBUGGING.md guide and extensively use our tools in docs/DEBUG.md

5. ALWAYS be mindful that the tests' expectations CAN and periodically ARE wrong and need to be updated so they do not mislead us.

5. stay laser focused on the selected issue and collecting and documenting information

6. ALWAYS RUN ALL THE TESTS WHEN YOU MAKE EDITS so you can be aware of regressions (use `npm test`)

7. if you have regressions, STOP and investigate what they are telling you and update your document. the regressions are useful information that reveal new assumptions and help validate / invalidate other assumptions
