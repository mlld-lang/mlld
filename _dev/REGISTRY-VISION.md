# mlld Registry Vision

Last Updated: 2025-05-29

This document outlines the vision for the mlld module registry ecosystem - where we're going and why.

## Vision Statement

**Create a decentralized, trust-minimized registry that enables safe code sharing while fostering innovation in the mlld ecosystem.**

The registry should feel as natural as GitHub for sharing code, as reliable as npm for dependencies, and as secure as OS package managers for system safety.

## Core Values

### 1. Community Ownership
- No single entity controls the registry
- Community governs policies
- Multiple registry mirrors possible
- Fork-friendly architecture

### 2. Zero Infrastructure Start
- Begin with GitHub gists + DNS
- No servers to maintain initially
- Leverage existing platforms
- Gradual infrastructure growth

### 3. Quality Over Quantity
- Curated initial modules set high bar
- Clear quality guidelines
- Community review process
- Reputation system emergence

### 4. Security by Default
- Content addressing prevents tampering
- Advisory system for vulnerabilities
- Progressive trust model
- Offline verification

## Evolution Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP (Now)
**Goal**: Enable basic module sharing with zero infrastructure

```
GitHub Gist → DNS TXT → Local Cache → Import Works
```

- Authors create gists
- Submit PR to registry repo
- DNS records point to gists
- CLI resolves and caches

**Success Metrics**:
- 50+ quality modules
- <300ms resolution time
- Zero maintenance burden

### Phase 2: Discovery (Next)
**Goal**: Make modules discoverable and browsable

```
Static Website ← Registry Data → Search Index
```

- Browse modules on mlld.ai
- Search by keyword/author
- Module documentation pages
- Installation statistics

**Success Metrics**:
- 1000+ monthly visitors
- <100ms search response
- Rich module pages

### Phase 3: Community (6 months)
**Goal**: Enable community participation and quality control

```
Advisories ← Community → Reviews → Reputation
```

- Security advisory system
- Module reviews/ratings
- Author reputation
- Quality metrics

**Success Metrics**:
- 20+ active reviewers
- <48hr advisory response
- Trust metrics adopted

### Phase 4: Federation (1 year)
**Goal**: Support private and alternative registries

```
Public Registry ←→ Private Registry ←→ Corporate Registry
```

- Private registry support
- GitHub repo modules
- Corporate firewalls
- Registry federation

**Success Metrics**:
- 5+ private registries
- Enterprise adoption
- Registry interop

### Phase 5: Ecosystem (2 years)
**Goal**: Rich ecosystem with diverse module types

```
Modules + MCP Servers + Themes + Templates → Marketplace
```

- MCP server registry
- Editor themes
- Project templates  
- Marketplace features

**Success Metrics**:
- 1000+ total packages
- 50+ MCP servers
- Sustainable model

## Module Types

### Core Modules (mlld code)
Traditional mlld modules with functions and templates
```mlld
@import { format } from @alice/strings
```

### MCP Servers (AI tools)
Model Context Protocol servers for AI integration
```mlld
@import mcp github from @tools/github-mcp
@mcp issue = github.create_issue({...})
```

### Themes (Editor support)
Syntax highlighting and color schemes
```json
{
  "type": "theme",
  "name": "@themes/dracula-mlld",
  "editors": ["vscode", "vim", "sublime"]
}
```

### Templates (Project starters)
Complete project structures
```bash
mlld create my-project --template @templates/api-docs
```

## Technical Architecture

### Decentralized Storage

                    └─────────────┘
```

### Trust Model
```
Content Hash → Signatures → Reviews → Reputation → Trust Score
     ↓             ↓          ↓          ↓            ↓
  Integrity    Authority  Community  History     Decision
```

### Discovery Mechanisms
1. **DNS**: Direct module resolution
2. **Search**: Full-text and metadata
3. **Browse**: Category/tag navigation
4. **Social**: Recommendations
5. **AI**: Semantic search

- **DNS hijacking** → DNSSEC + signatures  
- **Malicious modules** → Advisory system + scanning

### Social Risks
- **Toxic community** → Code of conduct enforcement
- **Corporate capture** → Foundation governance
- **Fragmentation** → Clear compatibility standards

### Economic Risks  
- **Unsustainable costs** → Progressive infrastructure
- **Volunteer burnout** → Paid maintainers
- **VC pressure** → Reject VC funding

## Call to Action

The registry vision requires community participation:

1. **Authors**: Share your best modules
2. **Reviewers**: Help maintain quality
3. **Users**: Report issues and feedback
4. **Sponsors**: Support sustainability
5. **Everyone**: Shape the future

Together we can build a module ecosystem that empowers developers while maintaining the simplicity and security that makes mlld special.

## Next Steps

1. Launch MVP registry with 10 showcase modules
2. Build static site for browsing
3. Create author documentation
4. Establish review process
5. Plan advisory system
6. Design MCP integration
7. Foster community growth

The journey of a thousand modules begins with a single gist.
