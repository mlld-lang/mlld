## Task: Synthesize Findings and Identify Problems

Review the individual analysis notes provided above.

**Synthesize these findings into a consolidated report focusing on patterns, problems, and inconsistencies.**

*   **Identify Common Patterns:** What are the recurring ways mocks are created, registered, and used? Are there good patterns emerging?
*   **Identify Inconsistencies:** Where do different test suites diverge in their mocking approaches?
*   **Summarize Key Problem Areas:** Which services seem hardest to mock? What types of errors (linter, runtime) seem related to mocks? Are there common issues with `vi.spyOn` or `TestContextDI` usage?
*   **List Skipped Tests:** Consolidate the list of skipped tests potentially related to mocking/setup complexity.

**Output Format:** Produce a markdown report summarizing the consolidated findings.

### Consolidated Mock Usage Analysis Report

**1. Common Patterns:**

*   (e.g., Most tests use `TestContextDI.createIsolated()`.)
*   (e.g., `registerMock` is consistently used for manual mocks.)
*   (e.g., `vi.spyOn` is frequently used to override default mock behavior.)

**2. Inconsistencies:**

*   (e.g., Some tests create large manual mocks, others rely heavily on default mocks.)
*   (e.g., Usage of `resolveSync` vs `resolve` varies.)
*   (e.g., Mocking of filesystem varies between direct `vi.mock` and `IFileSystemService` registration.)

**3. Key Problem Areas:**

*   (e.g., Persistent type errors when mocking `IStateService` and `IResolutionService` suggest incomplete default mocks or complex interfaces.)
*   (e.g., Runtime errors (`method does not exist`) indicate issues with spying on default/generic mocks.)
*   (e.g., Confusion around whether/how `TestContextDI` provides default mocks leads to conflicting registrations.)
*   (e.g., Boilerplate for manual mocks is high.)

**4. Consolidated List of Skipped Tests (Potentially Mock-Related):**

*   (e.g., `services/some.test.ts > describe > it.skip(...)`)
*   (e.g., `services/other.test.ts > describe.skip(...)`)
