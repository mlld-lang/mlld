I'll analyze the DefineDirectiveHandler code, its test file, and the relevant interfaces to identify any discrepancies.

# Interface Usage Audit: DefineDirectiveHandler

## 1. Interface Definitions Relevant to DefineDirectiveHandler

### IValidationService
- `registerValidator(kind: string, validator: (node: DirectiveNode) => Promise<void>): void`
- `removeValidator(kind: string): void`
- `getRegisteredDirectiveKinds(): string[]`
- `validate(node: DirectiveNode): Promise<void>` (implied from usage though not explicitly defined)

### IResolutionService
- `resolveNodes(nodes: InterpolatableValue, context: ResolutionContext): Promise<string>`
- `resolveText(text: string, context: ResolutionContext): Promise<string>`
- `resolveData(node: VariableReferenceNode, context: ResolutionContext): Promise<JsonValue>`
- `resolvePath(pathString: string, context: ResolutionContext): Promise<MeldPath>`
- `resolveCommand(commandName: string, args: string[], context: ResolutionContext): Promise<string>`
- `resolveFile(path: MeldPath): Promise<string>`
- `resolveContent(nodes: MeldNode[], context: ResolutionContext): Promise<string>`
- `resolveInContext(value: string | StructuredPath | InterpolatableValue, context: ResolutionContext): Promise<string>`
- `resolveFieldAccess(baseValue: unknown, fieldPath: AstField[], context: ResolutionContext): Promise<Result<JsonValue, FieldAccessError>>`
- `validateResolution(value: string | MeldNode | InterpolatableValue, context: ResolutionContext): Promise<void>`
- `extractSection(content: string, sectionHeading: string, fuzzyThreshold?: number): Promise<string>`
- `detectCircularReferences(value: string, context: ResolutionContext): Promise<void>`
- `convertToFormattedString(value: JsonValue, context: ResolutionContext): Promise<string>`
- `enableResolutionTracking(config: Partial<ResolutionTrackingConfig>): void`
- `getResolutionTracker(): VariableResolutionTracker | undefined`

### IStateService
- Used indirectly through the context parameter in the execute method

## 2. Handler Usage of Interfaces

The DefineDirectiveHandler class uses the following interfaces:

### IValidationService
- **Usage**: Injected in the constructor, but the actual `validate` method call is commented out (line 70).

### IResolutionService
- **Usage**: Injected in the constructor and used to:
  - `resolveNodes` (lines 119, 171) - Used to resolve interpolatable values

## 3. Test/Mock Usage

### Mock Creation
- `validationService` is created using `createValidationServiceMock()` (line 76)
- `stateService` is created using `createStateServiceMock()` (line 77)
- `resolutionService` is created using `createResolutionServiceMock()` (line 78)

### Mock Usage
- `validationService.validate` - Not directly tested since it's commented out in the handler
- `resolutionService.resolveNodes` - Mocked to return resolved strings (line 84-86)
- `stateService.getCurrentFilePath` - Mocked to return '/test.meld' (line 81)
- `stateService.setCommandVar` - Mocked and verified in tests (line 82, and various expectations)

## 4. Discrepancies

### Interface Mismatches

1. **IValidationService**:
   - The `validate` method is implied but not explicitly defined in the interface. It is injected in the handler constructor but commented out in usage.

2. **IResolutionService**:
   - No discrepancies found. The handler only uses `resolveNodes`, which is properly defined in the interface.

### Mock Mismatches

1. **ResolutionService Mock**:
   - The mock implements `resolveNodes` with an incorrect signature. In the test, `resolveNodes` is mocked to handle `InterpolatableValue` parameters, but the interface defines it to handle `MeldNode[]`. This inconsistency suggests that either the interface definition or the mock implementation is outdated.

2. **StateService Mock**:
   - The mock includes methods like `clone`, `getTextVar`, etc., that aren't used in the tests for this handler, but this is not a problem as the mock is reused across tests.

### Test Setup Issues

1. **Commented Validation Test**:
   - There's a skipped test for validation (line 244-249) because the validation call is commented out in the handler. This is not a discrepancy but a deliberate decision reflected in both code and tests.

2. **Type Inconsistencies**:
   - The test creates directive nodes with a simplified structure that might not fully match the actual AST structure. This could lead to test cases not properly exercising all edge cases.

3. **Unused Mocks**:
   - The test creates mocks for methods that aren't used in the handler, which isn't a problem but could be optimized.

## Summary

The primary discrepancy is with the `resolveNodes` method signature in the IResolutionService interface versus how it's mocked and used in the tests. The interface defines it to accept `MeldNode[]`, but the handler and tests use it with `InterpolatableValue`. This suggests that either:

1. The interface definition needs updating to include the overload for `InterpolatableValue`
2. The handler and tests need to be updated to use the correct parameter type

Otherwise, the handler implementation aligns well with the defined interfaces, and the tests properly mock the necessary functionality.
