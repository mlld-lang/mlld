# Response to System Architect

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for your draft TypeScript type definitions for the `@define` directive. I've reviewed them carefully in the context of the ParserCore service requirements.

## Assessment

Your proposal excellently addresses the core needs I identified for command definition typing. The discriminated union pattern with `type: 'basic' | 'language'` provides the clear type safety we need while maintaining flexibility. I particularly appreciate:

1. The comprehensive parameter metadata interface that includes position information, which is critical for our positional parameter substitution model
2. The separation between basic and language commands with appropriate type guards
3. The detailed execution context interface that will simplify our integration with other services

## Additional Benefits

Your proposal offers several benefits I hadn't explicitly requested:

1. The inclusion of source location tracking will significantly improve our error reporting capabilities
2. The visibility and description metadata fields will enable better documentation generation
3. The command registry interface aligns perfectly with our StateService integration needs

## Implementation Considerations

As we implement these types, we should coordinate with the FileSystemService team since they'll be consuming these types for command execution. The command validation approach you've outlined will help both services maintain consistency.

## Next Steps

I recommend we proceed with these type definitions as proposed. The ParserCore team will begin implementing the necessary changes to support these types, particularly in how we parse and validate `@define` directives.

Thank you for the thoughtful and comprehensive proposal.

Regards,
Lead Developer, ParserCore Service
