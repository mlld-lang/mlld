# Synthesize Execution Requirements for '@run'

## Context

You are the **System Architect**. You have received feedback from component leads regarding the execution environment, runtime variable resolution, and state management related to the `@run` directive.

**CRITICAL NOTE:** Focus *only* on the requirements for the *runtime execution* of commands/scripts initiated by `@run`. Ignore the static type definitions of the directive itself for now.

### Feedback on Execution/Runtime:

**CommandExecutionService Feedback:**
{{ CommandExecutionServiceFeedback }}

**ResolutionCore Feedback (Runtime Variable Usage):**
{{ ResolutionCoreFeedback }}

**StateCore Feedback (Command Definitions / Runtime State):**
{{ StateCoreFeedback }}

**FileSystemCore Feedback (Temp Files / Paths):**

## Task: Synthesize Execution & Runtime Requirements

Review the provided feedback. Consolidate the requirements related *specifically* to the runtime execution of `@run` directives.

*   Identify needs for the execution context (e.g., environment variables, CWD).
*   Note requirements for resolving variables *within* commands at runtime.
*   Consolidate needs for temporary file handling (language commands).
*   List requirements for accessing stored command definitions (for defined commands).

**Output Format:** Produce concise notes outlining the synthesized requirements for the `@run` execution environment and runtime behavior.

### Synthesized Requirements: @run Execution & Runtime

*   Requirement 1: (e.g., Commands should execute with specific environment variables available...)
*   Requirement 2: (e.g., ResolutionService must handle `\{{var}}` and `$path` within basic commands...)
*   Requirement 3: (e.g., Temporary script files for language commands require specific permissions...)
*   Requirement 4: (e.g., StateService needs efficient lookup for defined commands...)
*   (List other key execution/runtime requirements)
