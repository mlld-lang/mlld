# Review of @run Directive Type Proposal

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for the comprehensive type proposal for the `@run` directive. I've reviewed it carefully in the context of our CommandExecutionService implementation and the challenges we've been facing.

## Overall Assessment

The proposed type system is excellent and addresses most of our core needs. The discriminated union pattern for the three run subtypes (BasicCommandRun, LanguageCommandRun, and DefinedCommandRun) will significantly simplify our code by allowing for clear type-based routing and validation.

## Strengths of the Proposal

1. **Clear Subtype Classification**: The discriminated union with the `type` field will eliminate our current complex subtype detection logic.

2. **Parameter Handling**: The standardized Parameter and CommandArg types will unify our currently fragmented parameter resolution approaches.

3. **Security Controls**: The ExecutionContext interface with security settings is a welcome addition that will help us implement proper sandboxing.

4. **Metadata in Results**: Adding execution metadata to ExecutionResult will simplify debugging and improve user feedback.

## Suggestions for Enhancement

While the proposal is strong, I'd like to suggest a few refinements:

1. **Animation Control**: Our current implementation uses animation feedback during command execution. Consider adding `showAnimation` and `animationMessage` fields to the ExecutionContext interface.

2. **Error Handling**: We should add a standardized error type for command execution failures that includes the original command, error message, and any relevant context.

3. **Interface Alignment**: To minimize migration effort, it would be helpful if the ExecutionResult interface maintained compatibility with our current interface (stdout, stderr, exitCode) while adding the new metadata field.

## Implementation Impact

With these types, we can refactor our service to:
- Replace complex type detection with straightforward discriminated union checks
- Standardize parameter resolution across all command types
- Implement a unified execution interface with proper error handling
- Add robust security controls

I'm confident this type system will enable the code simplifications we've been hoping for and provide a more maintainable foundation for future enhancements.

Thank you for the thoughtful design. I look forward to implementing these changes.

Lead Developer, CommandExecutionService
