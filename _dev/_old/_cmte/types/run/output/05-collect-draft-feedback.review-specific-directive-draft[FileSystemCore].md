# Response to Architect

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for sharing the draft TypeScript types for the `@run` directive. I've reviewed the proposal in detail as it relates to the FileSystemCore service.

The proposed type definitions are excellent and address the core needs we discussed. The discriminated union pattern for the `RunDirective` type with clear subtypes (`BasicCommandRun`, `LanguageCommandRun`, and `DefinedCommandRun`) will greatly simplify our command execution logic. This will allow us to replace our current approach of manually determining run types with proper type-based handling.

I particularly appreciate:

1. The comprehensive `ExecutionContext` interface which will help us implement proper security controls for command execution
2. The unified `CommandReference` type that handles both string-based and AST-based references, resolving our current dual implementation issue
3. The standardized `Parameter` and `CommandArg` types which will streamline parameter resolution

This structure will enable us to refactor the `executeCommand` method in the FileSystemService to properly handle all run directive subtypes in a type-safe manner, eliminating our current ad-hoc approach.

One small enhancement I'd suggest is adding a `tmpDir` property to the `ExecutionContext` interface to specify where temporary script files should be created for language commands, as we currently use hardcoded paths.

Overall, this proposal exceeds my expectations and will significantly improve the maintainability and type safety of our command execution code. I look forward to implementing these types in the FileSystemCore service.

Best regards,
Lead Developer, FileSystemCore Service
