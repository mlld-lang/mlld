# File Import Execution Requirements

Based on the feedback from component leads, I've synthesized the following requirements specifically for the runtime execution of file imports, path resolution, and state merging:

## Path Resolution Requirements

1. Path resolution must support multiple path types (absolute, relative, variable-based) with proper validation at execution time.
2. Path resolution must handle special variables ($PROJECTPATH, $HOMEPATH, etc.) and normalize paths consistently across platforms.
3. Path resolution must validate paths against security constraints (null bytes, directory traversal attacks, path length limits).
4. Path resolution context must include base directory, working directory, and current file information for proper relative path handling.
5. Path resolution must support extensible validation rules (allowed roots, extensions, patterns) during execution.

## File Reading Requirements

1. File reading operations must detect and handle appropriate encodings (default: UTF-8).
2. File operations must include comprehensive error handling with specific error types (FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, etc.).
3. File content must be categorized by type (Meld, JSON, Markdown, etc.) at runtime for appropriate processing.
4. File reading should support section extraction for partial imports when specified.
5. File operations must maintain metadata about the source (path, size, last modified) for debugging and caching.

## Import Directive Execution Requirements

1. Import execution must track the full import chain to detect circular dependencies.
2. Import processing must support selective imports with aliasing.
3. Import handling must merge state correctly, respecting variable scope and precedence rules.
4. Import execution must handle "fuzzy" section matching when specified with a threshold.
5. Import execution needs consistent error recovery strategies for missing files or sections.

## State Merging Requirements

1. State merging must copy variables between states with appropriate type preservation.
2. State merging must respect import filters (selective imports) when specified.
3. State merging must handle variable aliases, mapping source names to target names.
4. State merging must track the origin of imported variables for debugging and circularity detection.
5. State merging must have configurable conflict resolution strategies (skip existing, overwrite, error).

## Error Handling Requirements

1. Import errors must include context about the source file, target file, and location in source.
2. Circular dependency detection must provide the full import chain in error messages.
3. File resolution errors must distinguish between different failure types (not found, permission, invalid format).
4. Import execution must support recoverable vs. fatal error classifications.
5. Error reporting must include sufficient context for debugging while maintaining security (no full paths in production errors).

## Execution Flow Requirements

1. Import execution needs a consistent lifecycle: resolution → validation → reading → parsing → state merging.
2. Import operations must be traceable with operation IDs for debugging complex import chains.
3. Import execution must respect depth limits to prevent infinite recursion even without cycles.
4. Import operations must be cancelable when parent operations are canceled.
5. Import results must include comprehensive metadata about what was imported and any issues encountered.

These requirements focus specifically on the runtime execution aspects of file imports, path resolution, and state merging, ensuring robust and secure handling of file operations in the system.
