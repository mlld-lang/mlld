# Synthesize File/Path Structure Requirements

## Context

You are the **System Architect**. You have received feedback from component leads regarding the internal TypeScript types needed to represent files, paths, and import-related data structures.

**CRITICAL NOTE:** Focus *only* on the *structure* of how paths, file content results, and import definitions are represented internally. Ignore runtime resolution/IO logic for now.

## Task: Synthesize File/Path Structure Requirements

Review the provided feedback. Consolidate the requirements related *specifically* to defining the TypeScript types for representing file paths, file content results, and import definitions.

*   Identify common needs (e.g., nominal typing for paths, interfaces for content results).
*   Note requirements for representing structured paths vs. simple strings.
*   Consolidate needs for representing the data associated with an `@import` definition itself.

**Output Format:** Produce concise notes outlining the synthesized requirements for internal file/path/import type structures.

### Synthesized Requirements: Internal File/Path/Import Structures

*   Requirement 1: (e.g., Use nominal type `MeldFilePath` for validated, absolute paths)
*   Requirement 2: (e.g., Define `FileContentResult` interface with `content: string | Buffer`, `encoding: string`, `sourcePath: MeldFilePath`)
*   Requirement 3: (e.g., Define `ImportDefinition` structure storing target path, selective imports, aliases)
*   (List other key structural requirements)
