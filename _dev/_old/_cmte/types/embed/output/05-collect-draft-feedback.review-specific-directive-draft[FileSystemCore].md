I'll analyze the proposed TypeScript types for the `@embed` directive and provide a response to the System Architect from the perspective of the FileSystemCore service lead developer.

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for sharing your draft TypeScript types for the `@embed` directive. I've reviewed them carefully against our requirements for the FileSystemCore service.

I'm pleased to report that your proposal addresses many of the core needs I outlined in my original request. The discriminated union pattern with `embedType` as the discriminator is particularly valuable for enabling type narrowing and exhaustive checks, which will help prevent runtime errors.

**Strengths of the proposal:**

1. The clear distinction between the three embed types (path, variable, template) aligns perfectly with Meld's behavior
2. The comprehensive documentation in JSDoc comments will help other developers understand the semantics
3. The inclusion of source location information will greatly improve our error reporting
4. The `EmbedResolutionContext` interface addresses the path prefixing issues we've encountered

However, there are a few areas where the types could be enhanced to better serve our FileSystemCore service needs:

1. **Result Types:** While your proposal focuses on directive parameters, we also need return type definitions for our file operations. Adding an `EmbeddedContent` result type would help consumers of our API understand what they're receiving.

2. **Integration with FileSystem Methods:** The proposal doesn't address how these types integrate with existing `FileSystemService` methods. We need to define method signatures that use these types, such as `readFileAsEmbedContent()`.

3. **MIME Type Support:** For file embeds, it would be helpful to add MIME type detection to provide more context about the embedded content.

4. **Backward Compatibility:** We need to ensure these new types can be gradually adopted without breaking existing code. Perhaps optional parameters or overloaded methods would help.

These additions would complete the picture and allow us to fully implement the type-safe embed handling we need in FileSystemCore.

Despite these gaps, your proposal provides an excellent foundation. The discriminated union pattern and the clear separation of concerns between embed types will significantly improve our code quality and reduce the potential for bugs. I particularly appreciate the thorough consideration of field access patterns for variable references.

I look forward to collaborating on the final implementation of these types. With the suggested enhancements, we'll have a robust type system that accurately represents Meld's embed directive semantics.

Sincerely,

Lead Developer, FileSystemCore Service
