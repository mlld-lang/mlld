I'll analyze the ValidationService implementation to identify any code that might need updates based on the AST structure changes.

## Findings

After carefully analyzing the ValidationService implementation, I don't see any direct interactions with the specific AST node properties mentioned in the context (children, parent, arguments, content).

The ValidationService primarily:
1. Registers validators for different directive kinds
2. Validates directive nodes by calling the appropriate validator
3. Handles validation errors

In the code, the service:
- Takes `DirectiveNode` objects as input for validation
- Accesses only the `directive.kind`, `location`, and `location.start` properties
- Delegates the actual validation logic to specialized validators that are imported but not defined in this file

The implementation doesn't directly access:
- The removed `parent` property
- The removed `arguments` property
- The `children` array
- The `content` property

Any necessary changes to handle the new AST structure would need to be made in the individual validator implementations (like `validateTextDirective`, `validateDataDirective`, etc.), which are imported but not defined in this file.

Therefore, no changes are needed in this specific ValidationService implementation file to align with the new AST structure.
