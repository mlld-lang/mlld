I'll analyze the ResolutionService implementation to identify any code that needs to be updated based on the AST structure changes mentioned in the context.

# Findings

After carefully reviewing the ResolutionService implementation, I've identified the following areas that interact with AST node properties:

1. **Lines 358-370**: The `parseHeadingNode` function examines TextNode properties. It correctly uses the `content` property of TextNode which is still valid in the new AST structure.

2. **Lines 376-384**: The `isHeadingTextNode` function checks TextNode properties. It correctly uses the `content` property which remains unchanged.

3. **Lines 531-533**: The `parseForResolution` method returns `interpolatableNodes` filtered from parsed nodes. It correctly checks for node types (`'Text'` or `'VariableReference'`) rather than relying on removed properties.

4. **Lines 554-558**: Similar filtering of nodes based on their `type` property, which is the correct approach.

5. **Lines 590-651**: The `resolveNodes` method handles `InterpolatableValue` arrays. It correctly uses the `nodeId` property for tracking nodes, which is consistent with the new AST structure.

6. **Lines 704-757**: The `resolveFieldAccess` method works with the `AstField[]` type which is explicitly imported. This appears compatible with the new structure.

7. **Lines 763-828**: The `resolveData` method accesses the `identifier` and `fields` properties of `VariableReferenceNode`. These properties remain valid in the new AST structure.

8. **Lines 1036-1047**: The `resolveInContext` method handles `StructuredPath` objects and checks for the `interpolatedValue` property, which is still valid in the new structure.

9. **Lines 1169-1182**: The `nodesToString` method processes different node types. It correctly accesses:
   - `content` for TextNode
   - `language` and `content` for CodeFenceNode
   - `directive.kind` and `directive.value` for DirectiveNode
   
   These properties remain valid in the new AST structure.

10. **Line 1313**: Imports `StructuredPath` from syntax types, which is still valid.

Based on my analysis, the ResolutionService implementation appears to already be compatible with the new AST structure. The code doesn't rely on the removed `params` or `content` properties, and correctly uses the `children` array and `content` property as needed.

No changes are needed to align this implementation with the new AST structure.
