I'll analyze the implementation of the ImportDirectiveHandler to identify any changes needed based on the AST structure changes.

## Findings

The ImportDirectiveHandler appears to be well-aligned with the new AST structure. It doesn't directly interact with the removed `children` or `content` properties. Here's my analysis:

1. **Line 93-95**: The handler accesses directive data through `node.directive as ImportDirectiveData`, which is the correct approach for the new AST structure.
   ```javascript
   const directiveData = node.directive as ImportDirectiveData;
   const pathObject = directiveData.path as StructuredPath; // Cast is safe after validation
   const rawImports = directiveData.imports;
   ```

2. **Lines 96-97**: The handler properly processes the imports array rather than looking for a `content` property:
   ```javascript
   const importsList = this.processImportsList(rawImports);
   ```

3. **Lines 75-89**: The `processImportsList` function correctly handles the imports array structure:
   ```javascript
   private processImportsList(rawImports: any): ImportsList {
     if (rawImports === '*') {
       return '*';
     }
     if (Array.isArray(rawImports)) {
       return rawImports.map(imp => ({
         name: imp.name,
         alias: imp.alias === null ? undefined : imp.alias
       }));
     }
     return undefined;
   }
   ```

4. **Line 172-174**: The handler correctly processes the AST nodes array returned by the parser:
   ```javascript
   const astNodes = await this.parserService.parse(content) as MeldNode[];
   if (!Array.isArray(astNodes)) {
     throw new DirectiveError(
   ```

5. **Lines 287-343**: The `importAllVariables` and `processStructuredImports` methods work with the variable structure but don't directly interact with AST node properties that have changed.

The implementation correctly uses the `directive` property to access the directive-specific data and doesn't rely on the removed `children` or `content` properties. It also properly handles the `imports` array which now contains parsed node structures.

No changes are needed to align with the new AST structure.
