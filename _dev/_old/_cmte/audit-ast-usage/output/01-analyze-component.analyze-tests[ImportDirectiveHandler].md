## Analysis of ImportDirectiveHandler Test File

After carefully reviewing the test file for ImportDirectiveHandler and comparing it with the AST structure changes described in the context, I've analyzed how the tests create, mock, and assert against AST node structures.

### Findings

The test file primarily focuses on testing the ImportDirectiveHandler functionality rather than directly asserting against the AST structure. Most of the AST-related code is in mocking the input and expected output for the handler. Here are the specific findings:

1. **No direct usage of removed `elements` property** - The test doesn't create or assert against the removed `elements` property directly.

2. **No direct usage of removed `arguments` property** - The test doesn't create or assert against the removed `arguments` property directly.

3. **AST node creation in tests** - The test creates DirectiveNodes using helper functions:
   - `createDirectiveNode` at lines 282, 350, 388, 417, 494, 544, 575, 616, 642, 673, 704, 744, 779
   - These helper functions likely handle the correct structure internally

4. **Mock AST nodes in parsedNodes array** (lines 417-420):
   ```javascript
   const parsedNodes: MeldNode[] = [
      { type: 'Directive', directive: { kind: 'text', identifier: 'greeting', source:'literal', value: [{ type: 'Text', content:'Hello' }] }, location: createLocation(1,1, undefined, undefined, finalPath) } as any,
      { type: 'Directive', directive: { kind: 'data', identifier: 'info', source:'literal', value: { val: 1 } }, location: createLocation(2,1, undefined, undefined, finalPath) } as any
   ];
   ```
   - These mocked nodes are correctly using the `value` property for directive content
   - The Text node is properly included in an array for the `value` property

5. **Mock AST nodes in parsedNodes array** (lines 459-463):
   ```javascript
   const parsedNodes: MeldNode[] = [
     { type: 'Directive', directive: { kind: 'text', identifier: 'var1', source:'literal', value: [{ type: 'Text', content:'value1', nodeId: crypto.randomUUID() }] }, location: createLocation(1,1), nodeId: crypto.randomUUID() } as any,
     { type: 'Directive', directive: { kind: 'text', identifier: 'var2', source:'literal', value: [{ type: 'Text', content:'value2', nodeId: crypto.randomUUID() }] }, location: createLocation(2,1), nodeId: crypto.randomUUID() } as any,
     { type: 'Directive', directive: { kind: 'text', identifier: 'var3', source:'literal', value: [{ type: 'Text', content:'value3', nodeId: crypto.randomUUID() }] }, location: createLocation(3,1), nodeId: crypto.randomUUID() } as any
   ];
   ```
   - These nodes correctly include `value` arrays containing Text nodes
   - Each node has a proper `nodeId` property

6. **Path structure usage** - The test uses the `raw` property of paths consistently throughout, which aligns with the recommended approach.

7. **Helper functions** - The test uses helper functions like `createDirectiveNode`, `createLocation`, and `createTestText` which may encapsulate AST creation logic. The implementation of these helpers isn't visible in the provided code.

**Overall assessment**: The test file appears to be compatible with the new AST structure. It uses the `value` property correctly for directive content and includes proper arrays of nodes where appropriate. The test doesn't directly reference the removed `elements` or `arguments` properties. Any potential issues would depend on the implementation of the helper functions used for node creation, which aren't fully visible in the provided code.
