I've analyzed the EmbedDirectiveHandler test file against the AST changes described in the context. Here are my findings:

## Findings

The test file is well-structured and doesn't appear to rely on the deprecated AST properties mentioned in the context. Let me detail my analysis:

1. **Creation of directive nodes**: 
   - The test uses helper functions like `createEmbedDirective` from test utilities (line 94) rather than manually constructing the AST nodes
   - No direct references to the removed `parameters` property
   - No direct references to the removed `content` property

2. **Test assertions**:
   - When examining the directive response in tests like the one at line 169, the code correctly asserts against the `replacement` property rather than deprecated properties
   - The assertions check `result.replacement[0]` which is compatible with the new `nodes` array structure

3. **Mock data structure**:
   - The test fixtures in the embed.ts file (provided in the relevant fixture) show the new structure with directive objects having properties like `kind`, `subtype`, `path`, etc.
   - The test doesn't directly mock these structures but uses factory functions that presumably handle the correct structure

4. **Template handling**:
   - The template handling code at line 398-416 correctly works with `InterpolatableValue` array which is compatible with the new AST structure
   - It correctly treats template nodes as an array of nodes

5. **Variable reference handling**:
   - Variable reference nodes are created with `createVariableReferenceNode` helper (used at line 399) which should handle the correct structure

6. **Node validation**:
   - The tests validate nodes using the validation service which would catch any structural issues

The test file appears to be compatible with the new AST structure. It primarily relies on helper functions and mocks rather than directly constructing AST nodes, which makes it more resilient to structural changes.

**No changes needed** for this test file based on the analysis of the AST structure changes.
