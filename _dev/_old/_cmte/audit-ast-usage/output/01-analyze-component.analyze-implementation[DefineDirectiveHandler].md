I'll analyze the implementation of the DefineDirectiveHandler to identify any code that needs to be updated based on the AST structure changes.

## Findings

After careful review of the DefineDirectiveHandler implementation and comparing it with the AST changes described in the context, I've identified the following issues:

1. **Line 56-57**: The code references `directive.parameters` but there's no clear indication in the context about the status of this property. If it was part of the `params` property that was removed, this would need updating.

2. **Line 73-76**: The code accesses `value` property directly from the directive. According to the context changes, we should now consistently use the `content` property to represent raw string content.

3. **Line 98-100**: The code attempts to resolve `value` using the resolution service. If `value` is now stored differently in the AST structure, this needs to be updated.

4. **Lines 130-132**: The code references `runData.command`, but the context indicates that nested structures like this may have changed. The comment "Keep assignment, remove check" suggests there might have been awareness of a pending change.

5. **Lines 141-153**: The code handles `runSubtype === 'runDefined'` and accesses `commandInput as { name: string }`. This may need to be updated if the structure of command inputs has changed.

6. **Lines 154-157**: The code attempts to resolve `commandInput` directly. If this is now stored in the `children` array, the access pattern needs to change.

7. **Lines 196-202**: References to `runData.parameters` might need updating if the `parameters` property was part of the removed `params` property.

Overall, the implementation doesn't explicitly reference the removed `children` or `params` properties directly by those names, but it does access properties like `directive.value`, `directive.command`, and `runData.parameters` which might have been reorganized in the new AST structure. The code needs to be updated to use the `children` array and `content` property according to the new structure.
