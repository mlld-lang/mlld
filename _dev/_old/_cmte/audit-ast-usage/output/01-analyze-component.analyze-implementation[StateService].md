After analyzing the implementation file for StateService, I'll check for any necessary changes related to the AST structure updates.

## Findings

After careful review of the `StateService` implementation, I don't see any direct interactions with the AST node properties mentioned in the context (`children`, `content`, `values`, `raw`). 

The StateService class mainly manages state variables, commands, and transformations, but doesn't directly parse or manipulate the AST structure itself. It stores nodes and can transform them, but it doesn't access the internal structure of directive nodes or parse their contents.

Looking at specific methods like `addNode`, `transformNode`, and `getTransformedNodes`, they handle nodes as opaque objects without accessing their internal structure. When nodes are transformed, the service simply replaces them with new node structures provided by other components.

The fixture provided shows the expected AST structure for a define directive, but the StateService implementation doesn't directly create or manipulate these structures - it only stores and retrieves them.

Therefore, no changes are needed in this implementation file to align with the new AST structure.
