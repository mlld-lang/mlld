I'll carefully analyze the implementation file to identify any code that needs to be updated based on the AST structure changes described in the context.

## Findings

After reviewing the ParserService implementation, I don't see any direct interactions with the specific AST properties mentioned in the context (the properties that were removed or changed). The implementation primarily:

1. Uses the `parse` function from `@core/ast/index` to parse content
2. Handles errors and validation
3. Deals with file paths and source mapping
4. Has some code fence validation logic
5. Contains variable reference resolution logic

The implementation doesn't directly access or manipulate:
- Any removed properties from nodes
- The `children` array structure
- The internal structure of directive nodes

The parser service is mainly responsible for invoking the parser and handling the results, rather than traversing or manipulating the AST structure directly. It treats the AST nodes as opaque objects and doesn't make assumptions about their internal structure beyond type checking.

The only place where specific node properties are accessed is in the `isVariableReferenceNode` method (lines 355-366) and in the `resolveVariableReference` method (lines 382-419), but these don't interact with the properties mentioned in the context that have changed.

Therefore, no changes are needed to align this implementation with the new AST structure.
