# FileSystemCore Service Improvements: Type System Enhancements for File Handling

After reviewing the FileSystemCore service code, I've identified several areas where TypeScript type system improvements could significantly enhance safety, maintainability, and developer experience when dealing with file operations, path handling, and import mechanisms. Here are my proposed improvements with detailed justifications.

## 1. Path Type Safety with Branded Types

### Current Issues:
- Paths are represented as plain strings throughout the codebase
- No compile-time distinction between normalized, absolute, or relative paths
- Path validation happens at runtime with potential for errors
- Frequent need for manual path normalization and validation

### Proposed Solution:
```typescript
// Path branded types
export type PathBrand<T extends string> = string & { __pathType: T };
export type AbsolutePath = PathBrand<'absolute'>;
export type RelativePath = PathBrand<'relative'>;
export type NormalizedPath = PathBrand<'normalized'>;
export type DirectoryPath = PathBrand<'directory'>;
export type FilePath = PathBrand<'file'>;

// Path constructors with validation
export function createAbsolutePath(path: string): AbsolutePath {
  if (!path.startsWith('/')) {
    throw new Error(`Invalid absolute path: ${path}`);
  }
  return path as AbsolutePath;
}

export function createNormalizedPath(path: string): NormalizedPath {
  // Normalize path (replace backslashes, resolve .., etc.)
  const normalized = path.replace(/\\/g, '/').replace(/\/\.\//g, '/');
  return normalized as NormalizedPath;
}

// Updated method signatures
resolvePath(filePath: string): AbsolutePath;
readFile(filePath: AbsolutePath | string): Promise<string>;
fileExists(filePath: AbsolutePath | string): Promise<boolean>;
```

### Justification:
1. **Improved Type Safety**: The compiler will prevent mixing different path types inadvertently
2. **Self-Documenting Code**: Function signatures clearly indicate what type of path is expected
3. **Reduced Runtime Errors**: Path validation happens at path creation time, reducing the need for repetitive validation
4. **Clearer Intent**: When a function accepts only `AbsolutePath`, it's clear that the path must be absolute
5. **Refactoring Safety**: Changes to path handling will be caught by the type system

The `FileSystemService` currently has many methods that manually resolve paths and perform validation. With branded types, we could ensure that paths are already validated by the time they reach critical file operations, reducing error handling complexity.

## 2. File Content Type System

### Current Issues:
- All file content is treated as string
- No distinction between different file types (text, binary, JSON, etc.)
- Manual parsing and serialization of structured content
- No content validation at compile time

### Proposed Solution:
```typescript
// Content type system
export interface FileContent<T = string> {
  content: T;
  contentType: string;
}

export type TextFileContent = FileContent<string>;
export type JSONFileContent<T> = FileContent<T> & { contentType: 'application/json' };
export type MeldFileContent = FileContent<string> & { contentType: 'text/meld' };

// Content constructors
export function createTextContent(content: string): TextFileContent {
  return { content, contentType: 'text/plain' };
}

export function createJSONContent<T>(content: T): JSONFileContent<T> {
  return { content, contentType: 'application/json' };
}

export function createMeldContent(content: string): MeldFileContent {
  return { content, contentType: 'text/meld' };
}

// Updated method signatures
async readFile(filePath: string): Promise<TextFileContent>;
async readJSONFile<T>(filePath: string): Promise<JSONFileContent<T>>;
async readMeldFile(filePath: string): Promise<MeldFileContent>;
async writeFile(filePath: string, content: TextFileContent | string): Promise<void>;
async writeJSONFile<T>(filePath: string, content: T): Promise<void>;
```

### Justification:
1. **Type-Safe Content Handling**: Content types are enforced at compile time
2. **Reduced Manual Parsing**: Specialized methods handle content conversion
3. **Clear Intent**: Method signatures indicate what type of content is expected or returned
4. **Improved Error Handling**: Content-specific errors can be handled more precisely
5. **Better Interoperability**: Content types align with web standards and facilitate integration

This would be particularly valuable for the `@import` directive, which needs to handle `.mld` files specifically. With content types, we can ensure that only valid Meld content is processed by the import mechanism.

## 3. Import Result Interface

### Current Issues:
- Import operation results are not clearly typed
- Error handling for imports is scattered and inconsistent
- No clear distinction between successful and failed imports
- Difficult to track imported entities and their sources

### Proposed Solution:
```typescript
// Import result interface
export interface ImportResult<T = unknown> {
  success: boolean;
  sourcePath: AbsolutePath;
  importedEntities?: string[];
  result?: T;
  error?: Error;
  timestamp: number;
  dependencies?: AbsolutePath[];
}

// Import tracking
export interface ImportRegistry {
  record<T>(result: ImportResult<T>): void;
  getImport(path: AbsolutePath): ImportResult | undefined;
  getDependencies(path: AbsolutePath): AbsolutePath[];
  hasCircularDependency(path: AbsolutePath, dependency: AbsolutePath): boolean;
}

// Updated method signatures
async importFile<T>(filePath: string, options?: ImportOptions): Promise<ImportResult<T>>;
```

### Justification:
1. **Standardized Result Format**: Consistent structure for import operations
2. **Improved Error Handling**: Clear distinction between successful and failed imports
3. **Dependency Tracking**: Built-in support for tracking imported entities and dependencies
4. **Circular Dependency Detection**: Easier to implement and maintain
5. **Better Testing**: More predictable results make testing more straightforward

The `@import` directive handler would benefit significantly from this structure, as it would have a clear way to track what was imported and handle potential errors consistently.

## 4. File Operation Context Enhancement

### Current Issues:
- Current `FileOperationContext` interface is loosely typed
- Context details are inconsistent across operations
- Error handling uses different patterns for different operations
- Path information is duplicated and potentially inconsistent

### Proposed Solution:
```typescript
// Enhanced operation context
export interface FileOperationContext<T extends string = string> {
  operation: T;
  path: string;
  resolvedPath: AbsolutePath;
  startTime: number;
  details?: Record<string, unknown>;
}

export interface ReadFileContext extends FileOperationContext<'readFile'> {
  encoding?: string;
  contentLength?: number;
}

export interface WriteFileContext extends FileOperationContext<'writeFile'> {
  contentLength: number;
  overwrite: boolean;
}

// Operation result
export interface FileOperationResult<T, C extends FileOperationContext = FileOperationContext> {
  context: C;
  success: boolean;
  result?: T;
  error?: Error;
  duration: number;
}

// Updated method signatures
async readFile(filePath: string): Promise<FileOperationResult<string, ReadFileContext>>;
```

### Justification:
1. **Consistent Logging**: Standardized context structure improves log consistency
2. **Type-Safe Operations**: Operation-specific contexts provide type safety
3. **Better Error Context**: Error handling has complete context information
4. **Performance Tracking**: Built-in timing for operations
5. **Reduced Duplication**: Path information is centralized and consistent

This would streamline error handling and logging throughout the `FileSystemService`, making the code more maintainable and easier to debug.

## 5. Path Validation Strategy Interface

### Current Issues:
- Path validation logic is scattered across methods
- Security checks are implemented inconsistently
- No clear way to enforce different validation policies
- Testing path validation requires complex mocks

### Proposed Solution:
```typescript
// Path validation strategy
export interface PathValidationStrategy {
  validatePath(path
