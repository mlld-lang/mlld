# Feedback on `run` Draft Specification (from InterpreterService)

## 1. Accuracy Assessment
The draft specification for the `run` directive generally aligns well with the InterpreterService needs. The core properties required for command execution are present, including command, id, arguments, working directory, environment variables, and output handling. The discrimination between different types of run directives (with/without output, language-specific) is appropriate for our service's implementation patterns.

## 2. Completeness Assessment
* Missing Property: `stdin` - The InterpreterService would benefit from a property to handle input to be piped to the command. This is often needed for interactive commands or when passing data to be processed.
* Missing Property: `async` - A boolean flag to indicate whether the command should be executed asynchronously would be valuable for long-running commands.
* Missing Property: `retries` - For handling transient failures, a property to specify the number of retry attempts would be useful.
* Missing Type: The specification should include a result type structure that defines the shape of execution results returned by InterpreterService.

## 3. Clarity & Usability Assessment
* The naming is generally clear and follows TypeScript conventions.
* Suggested Renaming: `Range` â†’ `SourceRange` to better indicate its purpose and avoid potential naming conflicts.
* The TSDoc comments are helpful, but could be more comprehensive for properties like `commandType` and `executionContext` to explain the implications of each option.
* The aliasing of `workingDir` and `cwd`, and `memoize` and `once` may lead to confusion. Consider standardizing on one term for each concept.

## 4. Potential Issues / Edge Cases
* Issue 1: The specification doesn't address how to handle binary output from commands. InterpreterService needs to know whether to treat output as text or binary.
* Issue 2: No clear mechanism for handling interactive commands that require ongoing input/output exchange.
* Issue 3: The `language` property in `MeldRunDirectiveLanguageParams` allows arbitrary strings, which could lead to unsupported language requests that InterpreterService can't handle.
* Issue 4: No consideration for command dependencies or execution order, which InterpreterService may need to manage complex workflows.

## 5. Validation Concerns
* Concern 1: Runtime validation will be needed for the `command` property to ensure it's executable in the given context.
* Concern 2: The `env` record should validate that values are strings or valid variable references at runtime, but the type doesn't enforce this.
* Concern 3: The `ErrorHandlingStrategy` includes a function type, which will need special serialization/deserialization handling in our service.
* Concern 4: The `id` property is marked as required, but there's no validation for uniqueness which is critical for our execution tracking.

## 6. Specific Improvement Suggestions
* Suggestion 1: Add a `RunResult` interface to clearly define the structure of execution results:
```typescript
export interface RunResult {
  exitCode: number;
  stdout?: string;
  stderr?: string;
  duration: number;
  startTime: string;
  endTime: string;
  command: string;
  id: string;
}
```

* Suggestion 2: Enhance the `executionContext` by adding more specific context information:
```typescript
export interface ExecutionContextConfig {
  type: ExecutionContext;
  constraints?: {
    maxMemory?: number;
    maxCpu?: number;
    networkAccess?: boolean;
    allowedPaths?: string[];
  };
}
```

* Suggestion 3: Add a `signal` property to allow for graceful termination of long-running processes:
```typescript
signal?: AbortSignal | { abort(): void };
```

* Suggestion 4: Add a mechanism for streaming output, which is important for long-running commands:
```typescript
streamOutput?: boolean;
outputStream?: (chunk: string, type: 'stdout' | 'stderr') => void;
```

* Suggestion 5: Standardize on either `cwd` or `workingDir`, and either `memoize` or `once`, rather than supporting both aliases.
