## Re: Review of Draft TypeScript Types for @embed Directive

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for the comprehensive type proposal for the `@embed` directive. I've reviewed it thoroughly against our codebase and requirements.

The proposal elegantly addresses our core needs with several key strengths:

1. **Clear Discrimination Pattern**: The discriminated union with `embedType` as the discriminator will significantly simplify our type checking logic in the `EmbedDirectiveHandler`.

2. **Specialized Resolution Contexts**: The `ResolutionContextFactory` with dedicated methods for each embed type directly addresses our variable resolution issues. The explicit `disablePathPrefixing` and `preventPathPrefixing` flags on the `VariableEmbedResolutionContext` will eliminate a major source of bugs.

3. **Type Guards**: The included type guards (`isPathEmbed`, `isVariableEmbed`, etc.) will replace our current complex subtype detection code with cleaner, more reliable type checking.

4. **Comprehensive Variable Reference Support**: The `VariableReference` interface properly supports both dot notation and array indexing for nested access, which aligns with our requirements.

I particularly appreciate the inclusion of the `ResolutionContextFactory` class, which will standardize context creation across our codebase and eliminate inconsistent configuration patterns.

The proposal will enable us to replace our current complex subtype determination logic with straightforward type guards, making the code more maintainable and less error-prone.

One minor suggestion: Consider adding a `fromDirectiveNode()` static method to the `ResolutionContextFactory` that automatically determines the appropriate context type based on the directive node. This would further simplify our handler code.

Overall, this type proposal meets our needs and will significantly improve the reliability and maintainability of the `@embed` directive implementation.

Sincerely,
Lead Developer, CoreDirective Service
