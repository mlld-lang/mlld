# Response to System Architect: Review of Embed Types Proposal

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for your comprehensive type proposal for the `@embed` directive. I've carefully reviewed it against our current implementation and the issues we've been experiencing.

## Core Assessment

Your proposed type system effectively addresses the "Variable Not Found" issue by providing:

1. **Clear Type Discrimination**: The discriminated union with `embedType` as the discriminator will eliminate our current complex runtime type detection logic.

2. **Specialized Context Types**: The `VariableEmbedResolutionContext` with explicit flags (`disablePathPrefixing`, `preventPathPrefixing`) directly addresses our path prefixing issues.

3. **Proper Variable Reference Structure**: The `VariableReference` interface provides a consistent structure that will simplify our variable resolution logic.

## Implementation Benefits

This proposal will enable several significant simplifications in the `EmbedHandler`:

1. The `determineSubtype()` method can be replaced with simple type guards, reducing ~50 lines of complex conditional logic.

2. The `handleVariableEmbed()` method can be streamlined by leveraging the structured `variableReference` property instead of our current multi-pattern detection approach.

3. The factory methods for resolution contexts will standardize our context creation, eliminating inconsistent flag settings that have caused bugs.

## Suggested Refinements

While the proposal is strong, I'd suggest a few refinements:

1. Add support for common formatting options across all embed types:
   ```typescript
   interface EmbedDirectiveParamsBase {
     // existing properties...
     headingLevel?: string | number;
     underHeader?: string;
     preserveFormatting?: boolean;
   }
   ```

2. Consider adding a `content` field to `EmbedVariableDirectiveParams` to support field access patterns that we're currently handling with custom logic.

## Conclusion

Overall, your proposed type system will significantly improve our code quality and reliability. It properly addresses the variable resolution issues while providing a foundation for cleaner implementation. We're eager to implement these changes and expect they'll eliminate approximately 30% of our current complexity in the `EmbedHandler`.

Thank you for your thorough work on this proposal.
