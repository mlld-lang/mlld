# Response to System Architect

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for the comprehensive draft TypeScript types for the `@embed` directive. I've reviewed the proposal in detail, focusing on how it addresses our variable resolution challenges in the ResolutionCore service.

## Assessment

The proposed types are excellent and address several key issues:

1. **Strong Type Safety**: The discriminated union pattern with `embedType` provides compile-time type safety that will eliminate many of our current runtime type-checking workarounds.

2. **Clear Semantics**: The separation into `EmbedPathDirectiveParams`, `EmbedVariableDirectiveParams`, and `EmbedTemplateDirectiveParams` perfectly matches our three distinct embed types.

3. **Resolution Context Factory**: This is perhaps the most valuable addition. The `ResolutionContextFactory` with specialized methods for each embed type will eliminate the error-prone manual context configuration we currently use.

4. **Path Prefixing Prevention**: The explicit flags in `VariableEmbedResolutionContext` (`isVariableEmbed`, `disablePathPrefixing`, and `preventPathPrefixing`) directly address the critical issue where variable embeds were incorrectly getting directory paths prefixed.

## Implementation Benefits

This type structure will allow us to simplify our `ResolutionService` code in several ways:

1. Replace our complex `determineSubtype` method with the type guards (`isPathEmbed`, `isVariableEmbed`, `isTemplateEmbed`)
2. Eliminate ad-hoc property checks by using the proper context interfaces
3. Standardize variable reference handling with the `VariableReference` interface
4. Use the factory methods to ensure consistent context configuration

## Suggestions

While the proposal is strong, I would suggest two minor enhancements:

1. Add a `fieldAccessOptions` property to the `ResolutionContext` interface to match our existing implementation, which would help with variable field access configuration.

2. Consider adding a `formattingContext` optional property to support our output formatting needs.

## Conclusion

The proposed types will significantly improve our code quality and reduce bugs in the `@embed` directive implementation. The discriminated union pattern and factory methods align perfectly with our service's needs and will help us simplify our complex runtime type checking.

I fully support implementing these types and look forward to refactoring our service to use them.

Sincerely,
Lead Developer, ResolutionCore Service
