# Response to System Architect

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for your thorough draft of TypeScript types for the `@embed` directive. I've reviewed the proposal in detail, considering how it will integrate with the ParserCore service and align with our architecture.

## Assessment

The proposed type definitions represent a significant improvement over our current implementation. The discriminated union pattern with clear type guards will greatly simplify our code by:

1. Eliminating complex runtime type checking through the `embedType` discriminator
2. Providing compile-time type safety for the different embed variants
3. Creating a clear, consistent interface for handling the three distinct embed types

I particularly appreciate the `ResolutionContextFactory` class, which will help prevent the path prefixing bugs we've encountered with variable embeds. The specialized contexts with explicit flags like `disablePathPrefixing` will make our code more robust.

## Suggested Refinements

While the draft is strong, I have two suggestions to enhance it further:

1. The `VariableReference` interface should align more closely with our existing `IVariableReference` in ParserCore. Specifically, we should use `fields` instead of `fieldPath` to maintain consistency with our current implementation.

2. Consider adding a `resolvedValue` optional property to `VariableReference` to store the result after resolution. This would simplify our parsing and resolution pipeline by providing a clear place to store the resolved value.

## Implementation Impact

With these types in place, we can simplify our `determineSubtype` method in the embed directive handler, replacing complex conditional checks with straightforward type guards. This will make our code more maintainable and less error-prone.

The factory pattern for resolution contexts will also help standardize how we handle the different embed types, reducing the likelihood of subtle bugs in our variable resolution logic.

I'm confident that with the minor refinements suggested above, this type system will serve our needs well and improve the reliability of our `@embed` directive implementation.

Sincerely,
Lead Developer, ParserCore Service
