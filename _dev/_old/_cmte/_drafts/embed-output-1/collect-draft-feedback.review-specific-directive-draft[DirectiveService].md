# Re: Draft TypeScript Types for Embed Functionality

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for providing the draft TypeScript types for the embed functionality. I've reviewed the proposal in detail, and I'm pleased to confirm that it effectively addresses the core needs outlined in our original request.

The discriminated union approach for `EmbedSource` is particularly valuable as it will eliminate the complex conditional logic currently used for source detection in our service. The clear separation between file and variable sources with appropriate type-specific properties aligns perfectly with our implementation needs.

The `EmbedOptions` interface provides the right level of flexibility while maintaining simplicity. I appreciate that you've kept it focused on essential formatting options that will cover our current use cases without overcomplicating the API.

The `EmbedRange` interface is intuitive and will simplify our partial content embedding logic significantly. The clear documentation on line numbering conventions (1-based for lines, 0-based for character positions) will help prevent subtle bugs.

The comprehensive `EmbedDirective` interface and the detailed `EmbedError` type will enable us to implement more robust error handling and provide better feedback to users, which was a pain point in our current implementation.

One unexpected benefit is the `EmbedResult` type, which provides a consistent pattern for success/failure responses. This will help standardize error propagation across our service boundaries.

We're ready to proceed with implementing these types in our service. The proposed structure will enable the code simplifications we identified and improve the overall robustness of the embed functionality.

Thank you for your thoughtful work on this proposal.

Regards,
Lead Developer, DirectiveService
