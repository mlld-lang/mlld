# Response to System Architect: @define Types Proposal Review

Dear System Architect,

Thank you for the comprehensive type definition proposal for the `@define` directive. I've reviewed it carefully against the needs of the VariableResolution service.

## Strengths of the Proposal

Your proposal addresses several key requirements excellently:

1. The discriminated union pattern with `type: 'basic' | 'language'` provides clear type safety
2. The detailed interfaces for both command types capture all necessary properties
3. The type guards (`isBasicCommand`, `isLanguageCommand`) will significantly improve our runtime type checking
4. The `CommandMetadata` interface adds valuable debugging capabilities

## Areas for Enhancement

While the proposal is strong, I would like to suggest a few adjustments to better align with our specific implementation needs:

1. **Command Name**: The `BasicCommandDefinition` and `LanguageCommandDefinition` interfaces should include a `name` property to match our existing code. This is currently missing but is referenced in the utility functions.

2. **Parameter Substitution**: The `substituteParameters` function is excellent, but we need an additional interface for parameter mapping:
   ```typescript
   export interface ParameterMapping {
     [paramName: string]: string;
   }
   ```
   This would help with our internal implementation of parameter substitution.

3. **Command Registry Interface**: To fully simplify our code, we would benefit from a formal `CommandRegistry` interface that abstracts command storage:
   ```typescript
   export interface CommandRegistry {
     commands: Map<string, CommandDefinition>;
     getCommand(name: string): CommandDefinition | undefined;
     registerCommand(definition: CommandDefinition): void;
     hasCommand(name: string): boolean;
   }
   ```

4. **Command Result Structure**: The `CommandExecutionResult` interface is good, but we would prefer to rename `stdout` to `output` to match our current implementation and add a `commandType` field to track which type of command was executed.

## Integration Benefits

With these adjustments, the type definitions would enable significant code simplifications in the VariableResolution service:

1. We could eliminate numerous runtime type checks and `instanceof` operations
2. Error handling would become more precise with type-specific error messages
3. Parameter validation would be more robust with explicit interfaces
4. The discriminated union pattern would allow for exhaustive type checking

Overall, your proposal provides an excellent foundation. With the suggested enhancements, it would fully address the needs of the VariableResolution service and lead to more robust, maintainable code.

Sincerely,

Lead Developer, VariableResolution Service
