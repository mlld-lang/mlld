Re: Type Definitions for DefineDirectiveHandler

Thank you for drafting the TypeScript types for the DefineDirectiveHandler. I've reviewed your proposal carefully against our service requirements.

The proposed type system is well-structured and addresses most of our core needs. I particularly appreciate:

1. The discriminated union pattern with BasicCommandDefinition and LanguageCommandDefinition
2. Strong typing for metadata with the RiskLevel type
3. The clear type guards and utility functions
4. Comprehensive documentation in the JSDoc comments

Your proposal would significantly improve our code by eliminating many manual validation checks and providing better compile-time safety.

However, I need to emphasize one critical requirement that isn't fully addressed: The `@define` directive in Meld **exclusively** embeds text content or variable values. This is fundamentally different from embedding executable code. Your proposal correctly separates basic and language commands, but we should clarify in the types that both ultimately result in text embedding.

I suggest these refinements:

1. Rename `commandTemplate` to `textTemplate` in BasicCommandDefinition to emphasize it's a text embedding
2. Add a comment clarifying that `codeBlock` in LanguageCommandDefinition is text content to be embedded, not executed
3. Consider adding a `contentType: 'text' | 'code'` property to make the text-embedding nature explicit

With these adjustments, your proposal provides an excellent foundation that will help us eliminate manual validation and improve code clarity throughout the DefineDirectiveHandler implementation.

I look forward to implementing these types in our service.
