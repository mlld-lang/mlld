# Test Deduplication Audit Tracker

## Purpose
Track the comprehensive audit of all service tests to identify duplicates between `.test.ts` and `.fixture.test.ts` files, and determine which tests need fixture migration.

## Audit Process
For each service/handler:
1. Read `.fixture.test.ts` file to understand coverage
2. Review each test in `.test.ts` file
3. Categorize each test as:
   - **Duplicate** - Functionality already covered by fixture tests (remove)
   - **Unique/Keep** - Tests service-specific behavior not covered by fixtures
   - **Needs Migration** - Unique test that should use fixtures

## Audit Status Overview

## Migration Priority

Based on the audit findings, prioritize migration in this order:
1. **ParserService** - 22 tests need migration to output fixtures (critical for AST stability)
2. **DataDirectiveHandler** - 3 tests need migration to fixtures (variable resolution tests)
3. **TextDirectiveHandler** - 2 tests need migration to fixtures (template and interpolation tests)
4. **Other Handlers** - 0 tests need migration (only duplicates to remove)

**Special Note on ParserService**: This is the highest priority because:
- It's the foundation of the entire AST system
- Output fixtures would catch any grammar/AST structure regressions
- All other services depend on consistent AST output from the parser

## Summary of Findings

### Overall Statistics (All Services/Handlers)
- Total test files analyzed: ~28 files
- Total manual tests reviewed: ~278 tests
- Tests identified for removal (duplicates): 52 (19%)
- Tests to keep (unique functionality): 199 (72%)
- Tests needing fixture migration: 27 (10%)

### Key Insights
1. **High Duplication Rate**: 41% of manual tests duplicate functionality already covered by fixture tests
2. **Unique Value Tests**: 49% of manual tests provide unique value by testing:
   - Service-specific error handling
   - Mock behavior validation
   - Edge cases not covered by fixtures
   - Integration patterns
3. **Limited Migration Needs**: Only 10% of tests need migration to fixtures
4. **Test Quality**: Fixture tests provide comprehensive coverage of AST node processing

### StateService
**Date Audited**: 5/19/2025
**Fixture Test File**: None
**Manual Test File**: `StateService.test.ts`
**Additional Test File**: `StateService.transformation.test.ts` (for specific transformation feature)

#### Test Coverage
- âœ… Setting and getting variables (text, data, path, command)
- âœ… Node management (add/get nodes)

- State manipulation operations
- Variable management
- State relationships (parent/child)
- Event emission
- Immutability guarantees

#### Summary
- Tests to remove: 0 (no duplicates)

#### Analysis
InterpreterService has only integration tests, which is appropriate for a service that orchestrates multiple other services. Tests focus on:
- End-to-end directive processing
- State management across interpretations
- Error propagation and recovery
- Integration with DirectiveService and StateService

#### Summary
- Tests to remove: 0 (no duplicates)
- Tests to keep as-is: 21 (all integration tests)
- Tests to migrate to fixtures: N/A (integration tests use actual services)
- **Note**: Service uses `createNodeFromExample` helper which needs migration

**Date Audited**: 5/19/2025
**Fixture Test File**: None
**Manual Test File**: `ParserService.test.ts`

#### Test Coverage

- âœ… Empty content handling
- âœ… Error handling (invalid/malformed directives)
- âœ… Variable reference parsing
- âœ… Field and array access in variables
- âœ… Location tracking and filePath inclusion
- âœ… Error location preservation

#### Analysis
ParserService is the core grammar parsing service. Tests focus on:
- Raw text â†’ AST transformation
- Error handling with proper location info
- Complex syntax parsing (interpolations, field access)
- Location tracking through parse operations

#### Summary
- Tests to remove: 0 (no duplicates)
- Tests to keep as-is: 0 (should migrate to fixture-based validation)
- Tests to migrate to fixtures: 22 (ALL tests could use output fixtures)
- **IMPORTANT**: ParserService could benefit significantly from output fixtures
- **Migration Strategy**: 
  1. Test provides input text
  2. Parser generates AST
  3. Compare against expected AST structure from fixtures
- **Note**: This would ensure parser output stays consistent with grammar changes
- **Note**: Would catch regressions in AST structure automatically

| should normalize a path with . correctly | Duplicate | Remove | Covered by fixture normalize tests |
| should normalize windows paths | Unique | Keep | Tests Windows-specific behavior |
| should preserve trailing slash | Unique | Keep | Tests specific normalization behavior |
| should validate paths (various validation tests) | Duplicate/Unique | Mixed | Some covered by fixtures, some unique |

#### Summary
- Tests to remove: 7
  - Basic path resolution tests covered by fixtures
  - Special path variable tests ($., $PROJECTPATH, $~)
  - Normalization tests covered by fixtures
- Tests to keep as-is: 13+
  - Tests with specific parameters (baseDir)
  - Edge case handling (empty input)
  - Platform-specific behavior (Windows paths)
  - Detailed validation logic tests with specific rules
- Tests to migrate to fixtures: 0 (unique tests are fine as manual tests)

### Migration Process
1. Identify appropriate fixture from `core/ast/fixtures/`
2. Replace manual node construction with fixture loading
3. Update assertions to match fixture structure
4. Verify test still validates intended behavior
5. Remove any resulting duplicate tests

## Notes
- Fixture tests should cover general AST processing behavior
- Manual tests should focus on service-specific edge cases
- Keep service dependency mocking separate from AST fixtures
- Document why specific tests are kept as manual tests
