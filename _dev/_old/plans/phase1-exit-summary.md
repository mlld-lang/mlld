# Phase 1 Exit Criteria Summary

## Phase 1: Interface Design & Validation - COMPLETE ✓

### Sessions Completed
- [x] Session 1.1: Service Interface Analysis
- [x] Session 1.2: Interface Design  
- [x] Session 1.3: Type Integration Design
- [x] Session 1.4: Validation Planning

### Exit Criteria Checklist

#### ✓ All service interfaces documented with full method signatures
- **IStateService**: 8 methods (minimal, already implemented)
- **IResolutionService**: 4 methods (needs consolidation from 15+)
- **IDirectiveService**: 1 method (already minimal)
- **IInterpreterService**: 1 method (already minimal)
- **IParserService**: 1 method (no changes needed)
- **IOutputService**: 1 method (needs minor updates)
- **IFileSystemService**: 7 methods (keep as-is)

#### ✓ Type flow from Parser → Interpreter → Handlers → Output documented
- AST node type hierarchy defined
- Handler input/output types specified
- StateChanges interface designed
- Resolution context flow mapped
- Error handling types included

#### ✓ Integration test scenarios defined for validation
- 70+ fixtures identified for testing
- Test scenarios for each directive type
- High-risk areas identified
- Test infrastructure designed
- Success criteria established

#### ✓ Detailed plan created for Core Services Migration phase
- Phase 2 features defined in AST-REFACTOR-PLAN.md
- Specific implementation steps identified
- Open questions documented
- Risk factors noted

### Documentation Updates Required

#### TODO: Update `docs/dev/TYPES.md` with finalized interface definitions
- Add minimal service interfaces from phase1-interface-design.md
- Include handler interface pattern
- Add StateChanges and ResolutionContext types

#### TODO: Update `docs/dev/ARCHITECTURE.md` if service relationships change  
- Service dependency graph from phase1-service-analysis.md
- Handler responsibility model
- Data flow patterns

#### TODO: Document any deviations from original plan in Rolling Updates Log
- No major deviations
- Confirmed adapter pattern is working
- Identified ResolutionService as biggest refactor needed

## Key Deliverables Created

1. **phase1-service-analysis.md**
   - Service usage analysis
   - Dependency graph
   - Methods actually used vs defined
   
2. **phase1-interface-design.md**
   - Complete interface definitions
   - Service initialization patterns
   - Type safety approach

3. **phase1-type-integration.md**
   - AST type hierarchy
   - Handler I/O types
   - Type flow examples
   
4. **phase1-validation-plan.md**
   - Test scenarios by directive
   - Fixture mapping
   - Risk assessment

## Ready for Phase 2 ✓

### Next Phase: Core Services Migration
- **Focus**: Implement ResolutionService with new minimal interface
- **Priority**: Fix variable interpolation (blocking integration tests)
- **Approach**: Start with ResolutionService, then update handlers

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Create minimal IResolutionService interface
2. Implement new ResolutionService  
3. Update ResolutionContext to include state
4. Fix TextDirectiveHandler variable interpolation
5. Run integration tests to validate
