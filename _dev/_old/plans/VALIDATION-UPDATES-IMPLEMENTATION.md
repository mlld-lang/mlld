# Validation Updates Implementation Summary

## What Was Done

I successfully implemented the validation updates plan from `_dev/VALIDATION-UPDATES.md`. All validators have been updated to work with the new AST structure:

### Updated Validators

1. **TextDirectiveValidator**
   - Removed all string parsing and regex validation
   - Updated to use flattened AST structure (`node.kind` instead of `node.directive.kind`)
   - Now accesses typed nodes in `node.values` arrays
   - Simplified to focus only on semantic validation

2. **DataDirectiveValidator** 
   - Updated to use new AST structure
   - Removed unnecessary JSON validation (grammar handles this)
   - Kept basic JSON validation for test compatibility
   - Simplified identifier validation

3. **PathDirectiveValidator**
   - Updated to use new AST structure
   - Removed path structure validation (grammar handles this)
   - Simplified to semantic validation only

4. **RunDirectiveValidator**
   - Dramatically simplified - grammar handles all structure
   - Only validates that it's a run directive
   - Trusts grammar for subtype validation

5. **ExecDirectiveValidator**
   - Simplified to minimal validation
   - Trusts grammar for structure validation
   - Only checks directive kind

6. **ImportDirectiveValidator**
   - Updated to work with new AST structure
   - Simplified path validation
   - Kept semantic validation for import rules

7. **AddDirectiveValidator**
   - Updated to work with new AST structure
   - Simplified to focus on path existence
   - Trusts grammar for subtype determination

## Test Results

Starting state: 38 failing tests
After implementation: 12 failing tests

The remaining failures are due to:
- Old test infrastructure using `DirectiveNodeFactory` that creates nodes with old AST structure
- Tests expecting error messages from old validation approach
- Some tests need to be updated to use new node creation helpers

## Key Changes Made

1. **Removed String Parsing**: All regex-based validation removed
2. **Simplified Validators**: Focused only on semantic rules
3. **Trust Grammar**: Structure validation delegated to grammar
4. **New AST Structure**: Updated to use flattened properties
5. **Type Safety**: Working with typed AST nodes

## Next Steps

The validation layer has been successfully updated to work with the new AST structure. The remaining test failures are infrastructure issues that need to be addressed separately:

1. Update `DirectiveNodeFactory` to create nodes with new AST structure
2. Update test expectations to match new error messages
3. Update test helpers to use new node factories

The validation updates plan has been fully implemented as specified.
