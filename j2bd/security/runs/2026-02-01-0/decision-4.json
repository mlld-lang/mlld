Following the logical documentation order from the job spec: signing-overview → sign-verify → autosign-autoverify → labels-influenced → pattern-audit-guard. The autosign-autoverify atom (m-6c50) documents policy automation for signing and is the next in sequence. This atom explains how to configure automatic signing of templates and automatic verification for LLM-labeled exes, which users need to understand before the capstone pattern-audit-guard example.",

Reference the existing signing-overview and sign-verify atoms for foundational concepts. All mlld examples must validate with 'mlld validate'."
