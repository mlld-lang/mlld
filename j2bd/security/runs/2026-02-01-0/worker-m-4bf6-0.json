All code examples validated with mlld validate."

    "progress": "Successfully created the signing-overview atom at docs/src/atoms/security/signing-overview.md. The atom explains: (1) The threat model - how prompt injection can manipulate LLM auditors, (2) Why signing solves this - cryptographic signatures can't be forged by prompt injection, (3) The verification flow - sign templates before interpolation, verify at runtime to detect tampering, (4) Sign templates not data - templates are control plane (trusted instructions), variables are data plane (potentially tainted), (5) Defense in depth - how signing complements labels/policy/guards. All mlld code examples have been validated with mlld validate and pass successfully.",
