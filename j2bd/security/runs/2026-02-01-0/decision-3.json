  "reasoning": "The sign-verify atom (m-e4d6) was successfully completed by the last worker - the file was created at docs/src/atoms/security/sign-verify.md covering sign/verify syntax, parameters, verification flow, signature storage, and CLI usage. All examples validated. The ticket needs to be closed so we can proceed to the next documentation task. After closing, the next priority is autosign-autoverify (m-6c50) which documents policy automation for signing, followed by labels-influenced (m-7505). The pattern-audit-guard (m-aa7e) is the capstone and should come last.",
