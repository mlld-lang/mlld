  "reasoning": "The last worker completed m-7505 (labels-influenced atom) successfully. The file exists at docs/src/atoms/security/labels-influenced.md and comprehensively covers: what influenced means, how to enable via defaults.rules, label propagation, policy restrictions, prompt injection defense, and when the label is/isn't applied. All examples follow mlld patterns from existing test fixtures. Closing this ticket so we can proceed to the final capstone atom (pattern-audit-guard) which ties everything together.",
