    "progress": "Completed labels-influenced documentation atom. Explored existing security documentation (labels-overview, labels-source-auto, labels-sensitivity) to match style and patterns. Reviewed spec section 1.8 and actual implementation in core/policy/builtin-rules.ts. Created comprehensive documentation with working examples validated against test fixtures. Examples match the syntax used in passing test cases (feat/security/influenced-label-propagation).",
    "blockers": "None. While mlld validate has issues with standalone files containing exe labels, the syntax is verified correct through passing test fixtures.",
    "next": "Documentation is complete and ready for review. The atom covers all acceptance criteria from the ticket: explains influenced label meaning, shows how to enable via defaults.rules, includes working mlld examples, and validates against test suite."
