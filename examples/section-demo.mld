# Section Extraction Demo

This example demonstrates the new bracketed section syntax for extracting
sections from markdown files.

## Old Syntax vs New Syntax

### Traditional syntax:
@text intro = "# Introduction" from [docs/guide.md]

### New bracketed syntax:  
@text intro = [docs/guide.md # Introduction]

## Renaming sections

### Traditional syntax:
@add "# Original Title" from [docs/api.md] as "# API Reference"

### New bracketed syntax:
@add [docs/api.md # Original Title] as "# API Reference"

## Using with @add directive

### Extract and rename a section:
@text docs = @add [README.md # Installation] as "# Getting Started"
@add @docs

### Direct section inclusion:
@add [CHANGELOG.md # Version 2.0]
