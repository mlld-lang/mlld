# Test Failure Analysis

This directory contains an analysis of the failing tests in the codebase. There are currently 31 failing tests across multiple files, which have been categorized and analyzed to identify root causes and potential solutions.

## Files in this Directory

- **summary-and-recommendations.md**: An overview of the issues and prioritized recommendations for addressing them.
- **test-failures.md**: A comprehensive categorization and analysis of all failing tests.
- **api-module-issues.md**: A detailed analysis of the missing @api/index.js module issue.
- **cli-service-test-failures.md**: A detailed analysis of the CLIService test failures.
- **parser-and-error-handling-issues.md**: A detailed analysis of parser and error handling issues.
- **architectural-insights.md**: Analysis of how the service architecture design may contribute to test failures, with proposed architecture-aware solutions.
- **implementation-examples.md**: Concrete code examples for implementing the recommended solutions, including mock service factories and test updates.

## Key Findings

1. The most critical issue is the missing @api/index.js module, which is causing 15 tests to fail.
2. Implementation changes in the CLIService, including the removal of watch mode functionality, are causing 13 tests to fail.
3. Changes in parser schemas, error message formats, and state handling are causing the remaining failures.
4. The application's service-based architecture with carefully managed dependencies may be contributing to test failures, particularly due to the circular dependency between the interpreter and directive services.

## Next Steps

Please refer to the **summary-and-recommendations.md** file for prioritized recommendations on how to address these issues. The most urgent action is to fix the API module issue, followed by updating the CLIService tests and error handling tests.

The **architectural-insights.md** file provides additional guidance on how to create more robust test mocks that respect the service architecture, including a proposed mock service factory implementation.

The **implementation-examples.md** file contains ready-to-use code examples that can be adapted to quickly implement the recommended solutions for the failing tests.

## Additional Notes

These issues likely stem from ongoing refactoring and evolution of the codebase, where implementation changes have outpaced test updates. This is a common challenge in fast-evolving projects, but addressing these test failures will help restore confidence in the test suite and ensure it effectively validates the codebase's functionality.
