# Meld Debugging Tools Implementation Handoff

Hi Claude,

I've been working on enhancing the state debugging tools in the Meld project, focusing on both variable resolution tracking and context boundary visualization. Here's what I've accomplished and what still needs to be addressed:

## What's Been Completed

### Phase 1: Focused Variable Resolution Tracking âœ… COMPLETED

1. **Enhanced `ImportDirectiveHandler` implementation**:
   - Added robust try-catch blocks around all `getCurrentFilePath` calls to prevent crashes
   - Fixed `parseImportList` to properly handle null/undefined import lists
   - Implemented performance safeguards to ensure zero impact when debugging is disabled
   - Updated test mocks to include the `getCurrentFilePath` method

2. **Documentation updates**:
   - Updated `_issues/features/enhanced-state-debugging-tools.md` to mark progress
   - Enhanced `docs/DEBUG.md` with context boundary tracking documentation
   - Created `docs/HANDOFF.md` with detailed handoff information

### Phase 2: Context Boundary Visualization ðŸŸ¡ IN PROGRESS

1. **Implemented foundational tracking**:
   - Successfully implemented state parent-child relationship tracking during imports
   - Added variable crossing tracking between contexts
   - Implemented performance-safe context boundary tracking
   - Established the dependency chain for the `StateDebuggerService`

2. **CLI interface for debugging**:
   - Documented the `debug-resolution` command and its options
   - Added boundary tracking flags to CLI options

These changes have successfully enhanced the tracking capabilities while reducing test failures from 33 to 27.

## Remaining Test Failures

The remaining failures fall into three main categories:

1. **Transformation mode issues** in `ImportDirectiveHandler.transformation.test.ts`:
   - Tests fail because state objects have a `mergeChildState` method not accounted for in expectations
   - The `replacement` node isn't being properly generated

2. **Circular import detection failures**:
   - Changes to error handling have altered how circular imports are detected and reported
   - Error propagation in transformation mode needs fixing

3. **Variable propagation problems** in API integration tests:
   - Variables aren't correctly transferring across context boundaries
   - Import handler may not be properly copying variables to target states

## Where to Focus

To complete Phase 2 and prepare for Phase 3, you should focus on:

1. Fix the state comparison in the transformation tests first (easiest win)
2. Restore proper circular import detection
3. Fix variable propagation in the API integration tests
4. Implement the remaining visualization components:
   - Context hierarchy visualization
   - Variable propagation visualization
   - Resolution path timeline visualization

Check `_issues/HANDOFF.md` for specific testing commands and detailed explanations of each issue.

The ultimate goal is to ensure our enhanced context boundary tracking works correctly while maintaining all existing functionality and adding the visualization capabilities outlined in Phase 2.

Good luck!
