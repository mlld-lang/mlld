# Investigate LLMXML Header Failure Handling

## Issue Description

The EmbedDirectiveHandler currently silently handles invalid heading levels (outside the range of 1-6) by returning unmodified content instead of throwing errors. This might hide issues that should be surfaced to developers.

## Investigation Points

1. Determine if llmxml's section handling capabilities can help validate heading levels
2. Assess whether we should throw errors for invalid heading levels or continue with the current approach of silent handling
3. Review the behavior across different handlers for consistency in error handling

## Context

- The EmbedDirectiveHandler's `applyHeadingLevel` method validates that heading levels are between 1-6
- Current behavior logs a warning and returns unmodified content for invalid levels
- llmxml handles section formatting and may have built-in validation we could leverage

## Priority

Low - This is not blocking any functionality, but should be addressed for better error handling consistency.
