# Automated Debug Issue Detection

## Overview

This feature enhances Meld's debugging capabilities by automatically detecting common issues with variable resolution, context boundaries, and state management. Rather than requiring users to manually analyze debug data, the system will identify patterns that indicate problems and provide actionable suggestions.

## Problem Statement

Currently, Meld provides powerful visualization tools to explore state and variable resolution, but interpreting this data requires significant knowledge of Meld's internals. Users must manually trace through resolution attempts and context boundaries to identify why a variable isn't resolving or why a template isn't behaving as expected.

## Goals

- Automatically detect common issues in variable resolution and state management
- Provide clear, actionable feedback about detected issues
- Reduce debugging time for users
- Make debugging more accessible to users without deep knowledge of Meld internals

## Non-Goals

- Creating a general-purpose error detection system
- Replacing existing visualization tools
- Automatically fixing issues (suggestions only)

## Feature Requirements

### Core Issue Detection

Implement detection for the following categories of issues:

1. **Unresolved Variables**
   - Variables that are referenced but never successfully resolved
   - Variables that are resolved in some contexts but not others
   - Variables that are undefined at the point of reference

2. **Boundary Crossing Problems**
   - Variables that fail to cross context boundaries
   - Variables that cross boundaries but with unexpected values
   - Directional boundary crossing issues (works parent-to-child but not child-to-parent)

3. **Inconsistent Resolution**
   - Variables that resolve to different values in different contexts
   - Variables with inconsistent types across contexts
   - Variables that are shadowed unexpectedly

4. **Import Chain Issues**
   - Circular import dependencies
   - Missing imports
   - Import order problems

5. **Performance Issues**
   - Excessive resolution attempts for the same variable
   - Inefficient resolution patterns
   - Variables that could benefit from caching

### Issue Reporting

For each detected issue, provide:

- Issue severity (error, warning, info)
- Clear description of the problem
- Contexts/locations where the issue occurs
- Detailed explanation with relevant data
- Actionable suggestions to fix the problem

### Integration Points

Integrate issue detection with:

1. **CLI Commands**
   - Enhance existing debug commands with issue detection
   - Add new commands specifically for issue detection

2. **Debug API**
   - Expose issue detection for programmatic use

3. **Test Integration**
   - Provide utilities for detecting issues in test cases

## Technical Implementation

### Phase 1: Instrumentation and Data Collection

1. **Enhanced Resolution Tracking**
   - Modify variable resolvers to collect comprehensive resolution data
   - Track resolution attempts, success/failure, values, and performance metrics
   - Implement configurable tracking to control overhead

```typescript
interface ResolutionAttempt {
  variableName: string;
  context: string;
  contextId: string;
  timestamp: number;
  duration: number;
  success: boolean;
  value?: any;
  error?: string;
  source?: string;
  callStack?: string[];
}
```

2. **Context Boundary Tracking**
   - Track context creation, relationships, and variable movement
   - Record import directives and their effects on variable availability

```typescript
interface BoundaryCrossing {
  type: 'parent-to-child' | 'child-to-parent';
  variableName: string;
  from: string;
  fromId: string;
  to: string;
  toId: string;
  success: boolean;
  timestamp: number;
  value?: any;
  alias?: string;
}
```

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Track time spent in resolution attempts
   - Count resolution attempts per variable
   - Measure boundary crossing overhead

### Phase 2: Analysis Engine

1. **Issue Detector Framework**
   - Create extensible architecture for issue detectors
   - Implement common utilities for pattern detection

```typescript
interface IssueDetector {
  detect(debugData: DebugResult): Issue[];
}

class UnresolvedVariableDetector implements IssueDetector {
  detect(debugData: DebugResult): Issue[] {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

2. **Individual Detectors**
   - Implement the five categories of issue detectors
   - Ensure each generates useful suggestions

```typescript
function detectUnresolvedVariables(data: DebugResult): Issue[] {
  const issues: Issue[] = [];
  
  // Group attempts by variable name
  const attemptsByVariable = groupBy(data.attempts, 'variableName');
  
  // Find variables with only failed resolution attempts
  for (const [varName, attempts] of Object.entries(attemptsByVariable)) {
    if (attempts.length > 0 && !attempts.some(a => a.success)) {
      // Analyze contexts and generate suggestions
      // ...
      
      issues.push({
        type: 'unresolved_variable',
        severity: 'error',
        message: `Variable '${varName}' was never successfully resolved`,
        contexts: attempts.map(a => a.context),
        suggestions: [
          'Check if the variable is defined in an accessible scope',
          'Verify variable name spelling',
          'Check import directives',
          // More specific suggestions based on analysis
        ]
      });
    }
  }
  
  return issues;
}
```

3. **Suggestion Engine**
   - Implement context-aware suggestion generation
   - Ensure suggestions are actionable and relevant

```typescript
function generateSuggestions(issue: Issue, debugData: DebugResult): string[] {
  // Generate suggestions based on issue type and context
  switch (issue.type) {
    case 'unresolved_variable':
      return generateUnresolvedVariableSuggestions(issue, debugData);
    case 'boundary_crossing_failure':
      return generateBoundarySuggestions(issue, debugData);
    // Other issue types...
  }
}
```

### Phase 3: Integration and User Experience

1. **CLI Integration**
   - Update debug commands to include issue detection
   - Add formatting options for issue output

```typescript
// CLI command implementation
async function debugResolution(file: string, varName: string, options: any) {
  // Enable debug tracking
  debugTracker.configure({
    enabled: true,
    watchVariables: [varName],
    samplingRate: options.sampleRate || 1.0
  });
  
  // Process the file
  await processFile(file);
  
  // Get debug data
  const debugData = debugTracker.getDebugData(varName);
  
  // Detect issues
  const issueDetector = new IssueDetectorService();
  const issues = issueDetector.detectIssues(debugData);
  
  // Generate report
  const report = formatDebugReport(debugData, issues, options.format);
  
  // Output report
  console.log(report);
}
```

2. **Report Formatting**
   - Implement formatters for different output styles
   - Support text, JSON, and potentially HTML formats

```typescript
function formatTextReport(debugData: DebugResult, issues: Issue[]): string {
  let report = `DEBUG REPORT: ${debugData.variable}\n\n`;
  
  if (issues.length === 0) {
    report += "No issues detected.\n";
  } else {
    report += `ISSUES (${issues.length}):\n\n`;
    
    issues.forEach((issue, i) => {
      report += `Issue #${i+1}: ${issue.severity.toUpperCase()} - ${issue.message}\n`;
      report += `Contexts: ${issue.contexts.join(', ')}\n`;
      report += `Details: ${issue.details || 'No additional details'}\n`;
      report += "Suggestions:\n";
      
      issue.suggestions.forEach(s => {
        report += `  â€¢ ${s}\n`;
      });
      
      report += "\n";
    });
  }
  
  return report;
}
```

3. **Test Framework Integration**
   - Create APIs for using issue detection in test cases
   - Provide utilities for asserting on detected issues

```typescript
import { enableDebugTracking, detectIssues } from '@meld/debug';

test('should resolve variables from imports correctly', async () => {
  // Enable tracking with issue detection
  enableDebugTracking({ 
    trackVariables: true,
    watchVariables: ['userData'],
    detectIssues: true
  });
  
  const result = await processFile('test.meld');
  
  // Get issues if test fails
  if (!result.includes('expectedValue')) {
    const debugData = await getDebugData('userData');
    const issues = detectIssues(debugData);
    
    console.log(formatTextReport(debugData, issues));
    
    // Can also assert on issues
    expect(issues.some(i => i.type === 'unresolved_variable')).toBe(false);
  }
  
  expect(result).toContain('expectedValue');
});
```
