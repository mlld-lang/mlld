# Meld Debugging Tools: Implementation Status and Roadmap

## Current Implementation: ASCII Visualization

We've successfully implemented and integrated the mermaid-ascii wrapper into the Meld debugging tools, achieving several key milestones:

### âœ… Completed Features

1. **Terminal-Friendly Visualization**
   - Added ASCII as a supported output format alongside Mermaid, DOT, and JSON
   - Created a wrapper around the mermaid-ascii binary that handles conversion
   - Implemented a fallback rendering when the binary isn't available

2. **Comprehensive Integration**
   - Enhanced all visualization methods in `StateVisualizationService` to support ASCII output
   - Added support for customizing ASCII output (width, height, colors)
   - Created adapter patterns for easy integration with existing services

3. **Utility Tools and Examples**
   - Created example CLI commands demonstrating ASCII visualization usage
   - Built demo and example files showing how to use the wrapper
   - Developed CLI integration examples that show real-world usage patterns

### ðŸ”„ Partially Complete

1. **CLI Command Integration**
   - Created example integration but not yet fully integrated with main CLI
   - Demonstrated patterns for CLI integration through example files

2. **Environment Variable Support**
   - Some environment variables exist but not full support for all debug options

## Next Steps: Automated Issue Detection

The next major enhancement to the debugging tools will be implementing automated issue detection. This feature will detect common problems with variable resolution, context boundaries, and state management, converting raw debug data into actionable insights.

### Planned Features

1. **Core Issue Detection**
   - Unresolved variables
   - Boundary crossing problems
   - Inconsistent resolution
   - Import chain issues
   - Performance problems

2. **Issue Reporting**
   - Severity levels (error, warning, info)
   - Context-aware suggestions
   - Detailed explanations
   - Actionable recommendations

3. **Integration**
   - CLI command integration
   - Debug API for programmatic use
   - Test framework integration

### Implementation Plan

The implementation will follow these phases:

1. **Phase 1: Data Collection (2-3 days)**
   - Instrument variable resolvers and boundary crossing
   - Collect comprehensive resolution data
   - Track performance metrics

2. **Phase 2: Analysis Engine (3-4 days)**
   - Build the issue detector framework
   - Implement pattern recognition for common problems
   - Create the suggestion engine

3. **Phase 3: Integration (2-3 days)**
   - Update CLI commands
   - Implement reporting formats
   - Create user-friendly output

4. **Phase 4: Testing and Refinement (2-3 days)**
   - Create test cases covering all issue types
   - Refine detection algorithms
   - Reduce false positives

5. **Phase 5: Documentation (1-2 days)**
   - Update user documentation
   - Create examples
   - Document the API

## Future Roadmap

After implementing the current visualization improvements and automated issue detection, the following enhancements are planned:

1. **IDE Integration**
   - VSCode extension for debugging
   - In-editor visualization
   - Code action suggestions based on issue detection

2. **Interactive Debugging**
   - Interactive sessions with real-time analysis
   - Step-through debugging for complex resolution paths

3. **Machine Learning Enhancements**
   - Suggestion quality improvements based on user feedback
   - Project-specific pattern detection

## Conclusion

The debugging tools are evolving from simple data visualization to intelligent issue detection and resolution. The successful implementation of the ASCII visualization capabilities provides a strong foundation for the more advanced automated issue detection features.

By following this roadmap, Meld will offer a debugging experience that both presents useful data and provides intelligent insights about potential problems, making it significantly easier for users to diagnose and fix issues in their templates.
