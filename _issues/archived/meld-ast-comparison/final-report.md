# meld-ast Regression Analysis: Version 3.0.1 vs 3.3.0

## Executive Summary

This report documents the regression analysis between meld-ast versions 3.0.1 and 3.3.0. The primary finding is that version 3.3.0 introduces support for array bracket notation (`[index]`), which was not available in 3.0.1. This fundamental change in syntax handling is likely the root cause of the observed regressions.

## Key Findings

1. **Array Notation Support**:
   - Version 3.0.1 does not support bracket notation for array access
   - Version 3.3.0 introduces support for bracket notation
   - This change affects at least 7 test files with 52 occurrences of array notation

2. **Error Messages**:
   - Version 3.0.1: `Expected ".", ">>", "}}", [a-zA-Z0-9_], or whitespace but "[" found`
   - Version 3.3.0: Successfully parses array notation in most cases

3. **AST Structure Changes**:
   - Version 3.3.0 introduces a new field type `"index"` in the AST to represent array indices
   - This structural change affects how array elements are accessed and represented

## Test Cases

We created three specific test cases to demonstrate the differences:

1. **Simple Array Access** (`array-notation-simple.meld`):
   ```
   @data fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
   
   Bracket notation: {{fruits[0]}}, {{fruits[1]}}, {{fruits[2]}}
   ```
   - Version 3.0.1: ❌ Fails with syntax error
   - Version 3.3.0: ✅ Successfully parses and generates correct AST

2. **Nested Array Access** (`array-notation-nested.meld`):
   ```
   @data users = [
     { name: "Alice", hobbies: ["reading", "hiking"] },
     { name: "Bob", hobbies: ["gaming", "cooking"] }
   ]
   
   User 1: {{users[0].name}} - {{users[0].hobbies[0]}}
   User 2: {{users[1].name}} - {{users[1].hobbies[1]}}
   ```
   - Version 3.0.1: ❌ Fails with syntax error
   - Version 3.3.0: ✅ Successfully parses and generates correct AST

3. **Variable Index Access** (`array-variable-index.meld`):
   ```
   @data fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
   @data index = 1
   
   Using variable index: {{fruits[index]}}
   ```
   - Version 3.0.1: ❌ Fails with syntax error
   - Version 3.3.0: ❌ Fails with different syntax error

## Affected Files

Our analysis identified 7 test files that use array notation and are likely affected by this change:

1. `tests/utils/tests/TestContext.test.ts` (14 occurrences)
2. `tests/meld-ast-nested-fences.test.ts` (10 occurrences)
3. `tests/utils/debug/StateHistoryService/StateHistoryService.test.ts` (10 occurrences)
4. `tests/cli/cli-error-handling.test.ts` (6 occurrences)
5. `tests/utils/debug/StateDebuggerService/StateDebuggerService.test.ts` (6 occurrences)
6. `tests/utils/debug/StateVisualizationService/StateVisualizationService.test.ts` (5 occurrences)
7. `tests/utils/debug/StateTrackingService/StateTrackingService.test.ts` (1 occurrence)

## Recommendations

1. **Migration Strategy**:
   - Update test files to use the new array notation syntax supported in 3.3.0
   - Consider creating a compatibility layer if backward compatibility is required

2. **Documentation**:
   - Document the syntax change in the release notes
   - Provide migration examples for users upgrading from 3.0.1 to 3.3.0

3. **Testing**:
   - Add specific tests for array notation to prevent future regressions
   - Consider adding tests for variable index access, which still has issues

## Conclusion

The primary regression between versions 3.0.1 and 3.3.0 is a fundamental change in how array access is handled. Version 3.3.0 introduces support for bracket notation (`[index]`), which was not available in 3.0.1.

This change likely causes cascading failures in existing code that may have used alternative approaches to access array elements in 3.0.1. Any code that relied on the previous behavior or error handling would need to be updated to work with the new array notation support in 3.3.0.

The variable index access case still fails in both versions, but with different error messages, suggesting that dynamic array indexing is not fully supported even in 3.3.0.
