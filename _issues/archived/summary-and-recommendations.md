# Test Failures: Summary and Recommendations

## Overview

There are currently 31 failing tests in the test suite. These failures appear to be related to changes in implementation, module structure, and error handling that have not been reflected in the tests. Based on the analysis of the service architecture and dependencies, many of these issues are interconnected through the application's service dependency system.

## Priority Issues

### 1. Missing @api/index.js Module (15 tests)

**Issue**: The module `@api/index.js` is imported but not found, causing 15 tests to fail. This is a critical issue that affects many test files, particularly those that depend on the API services to initialize properly according to the service dependency structure.

**Impact**: This prevents proper service initialization and causes cascading failures throughout the test suite.

### 2. CLIService Implementation Changes (13 tests)

**Issue**: The CLIService implementation has changed, including the removal of watch mode functionality and updates to module imports. These changes have rendered the existing tests obsolete, as they expect behaviors and error patterns that no longer match the current implementation.

**Impact**: Tests that mock or interact with the CLIService are failing due to mismatched expectations and implementation.

### 3. Parser and Error Handling Changes (3 tests)

**Issue**: Changes in the parser schema and error message formats have broken tests that rely on specific error patterns or schema structures. These issues are often related to how errors propagate through the service dependency chain.

**Impact**: Tests verifying error handling and parser functionality are failing because they expect outdated message formats or schema structures.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Fix the API Module Issue**:
   - Investigate why the JavaScript files for the API module are not being generated or found
   - Update the build configuration to ensure the API module is properly transpiled and available
   - Update imports in the CLIService to use the correct path for the API module
   - Consider implementing the mock service factory pattern to respect service dependencies in tests

2. **Update CLIService Tests**:
   - Remove tests for watch mode functionality if it's no longer supported
   - Update error handling tests to match the new implementation
   - Update mocks to reflect the current CLIService structure
   - Ensure test mocks properly handle service dependencies as defined in `dependencies.ts`

3. **Update Error Tests**:
   - Update expected error message formats in tests to match the current implementation
   - Update schema-dependent tests to align with the current schema
   - Review error propagation through the service dependency chain
   - Ensure consistent error handling across the codebase

### Medium-Term Actions

1. **Review Schema-Dependent Tests**:
   - Identify all tests that depend on specific schema structures
   - Consider making tests more resilient to schema changes
   - Document the current schema for developers

2. **Improve Test Resilience**:
   - Make tests less brittle by focusing on behavior rather than specific implementation details
   - Use more flexible matching for error messages where possible
   - Consider using snapshot testing for complex structures

3. **Document Changes**:
   - Update documentation to reflect changes in the CLIService and API module
   - Clearly document the service dependency structure and initialization requirements
   - Create examples of proper mock implementation for common testing scenarios

### Long-Term Improvements

1. **Implement Schema Validation**:
   - Add schema validation to catch changes that would break tests
   - Implement versioning for schemas to manage compatibility

2. **Enhance Test Infrastructure**:
   - Create a more robust mock system that respects service dependencies
   - Implement the proposed mock service factory pattern described in `architectural-insights.md`
   - Consider creating a test helper library for common testing scenarios

3. **Improve CI Process**:
   - Add checks to ensure that schema changes are reflected in tests
   - Add specific test workflow for critical functionality
   - Consider implementing visual regression testing for UI components

## Next Steps

The highest priority is to fix the API module issue, as it is blocking many tests. Once this is resolved, the focus should shift to updating the CLIService tests and error handling tests, which will address the majority of the failing tests.

Implementing the architecture-aware solutions outlined in the architectural-insights.md document, particularly the mock service factory pattern, will help create more reliable tests that respect the service dependency structure of the application.
