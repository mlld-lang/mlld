# meld-ast Regression Analysis: Executive Summary

## Overview

This analysis investigates the regressions observed when upgrading from meld-ast version 3.0.1 to 3.3.0. Our findings clarify that there are no bugs in meld-ast itself, but rather a significant change in how array notation is handled between these versions.

## Key Findings

1. **Contrary to initial understanding**, meld-ast 3.3.0 does support bracket notation for array access, but represents it differently in the AST.

2. **Version evolution**:
   - **3.0.1**: Did not support bracket notation at all (threw syntax errors)
   - **3.1**: Added bracket notation support (as stated in the changelog)
   - **3.3.0**: Changed the implementation, but still supports bracket notation

3. **AST structure changes**:
   - Array indices are now represented with field type `"index"` instead of string identifiers
   - Numeric values are now actual numbers, not strings (e.g., `value: 0` vs `value: "0"`)

4. **Impact**: 7 test files with approximately 52 occurrences of array notation are affected

## Next Steps

Since backward compatibility is not required and there are no users yet, the recommendation is to:

1. **Update the tests** to correctly validate the new AST structure in 3.3.0:
   - Replace assertions expecting errors on bracket notation
   - Update type expectations from "identifier" to "index" for array indices
   - Change expected string values to numbers for array indices

2. **Add test cases** specifically for array notation to prevent future regressions

3. **Document the changes** in your internal documentation for developer reference

4. **Consider the variable index limitation** - both versions struggle with dynamic indices like `array[variable]`

5. **Leverage security benefits** - take advantage of the enhanced type safety and security features provided by the new AST structure

## Conclusion

The regression is not due to bugs in meld-ast, but rather a significant change in how array access is represented in the AST. With the information and guidance provided in this analysis, updating the tests to work with version 3.3.0 should be straightforward.

The tools and test cases we've provided offer a clear path to understanding exactly what changed and how to adapt your codebase accordingly.
