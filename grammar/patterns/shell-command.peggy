// SHELL COMMAND - Legacy file, patterns moved to unified-commands.peggy

/* 
# Shell Command Patterns

All shell command logic is now handled by unified-commands.peggy.
This file exists for compatibility but contains no active patterns.
The original adapter patterns have been removed as part of the consolidation.

Security validation for banned operators is preserved in unified-commands.peggy.
