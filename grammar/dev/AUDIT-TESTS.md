# Grammar Tests Audit

This document contains the results of our grammar tests audit, examining the test coverage, organization, and potential improvements for the Meld grammar implementation.

## Current Test Architecture

The Meld grammar testing is organized in several locations:

1. **Directive Tests** (`grammar/tests/`): Tests for specific directives
2. **General Grammar Tests**: Tests for overall grammar functionality

## Audit Process

We'll examine all the test files in the `grammar/tests/` directory and identify:
- Test coverage for each directive
- Edge cases that are/aren't currently tested
- Test organization and structure
- Potential areas for improvement

## Findings

TBD - Will be filled after code review

## Recommendations 

TBD - Will be filled after code review
