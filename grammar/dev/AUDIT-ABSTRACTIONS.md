# Grammar Abstractions Audit

This document will contain the results of our grammar abstractions audit, including:

1. Patterns that should be consolidated for better maintainability
2. Unused abstractions that could be removed
3. Recommendations for new abstractions to improve consistency

## Audit Process

We will review:
- All grammar files in `/directives`
- All lexer files in `/lexer`
- Helper files in `core/`
- Determine if `deps/` directory is still needed

## Findings

TBD - To be filled in after audit completion

## Recommendations

TBD - To be filled in after audit completion
