# Grammar Refactoring Implementation Progress

## Completed Work

### Phase 1-4: Structure and Patterns
- âœ… Created new directory structure (`base/`, `patterns/`, `core/`, `directives/`)
- âœ… Implemented base abstractions in `base/`:
  - `context.peggy` - Context predicates for @ disambiguation
  - `tokens.peggy` - Basic token patterns
  - `literals.peggy` - Literal value patterns
  - `segments.peggy` - Text segment patterns
  - `whitespace.peggy` - Whitespace handling
- âœ… Implemented pattern abstractions in `patterns/`:
  - `variables.peggy` - Variable reference patterns with context detection
  - `fields.peggy` - Field access patterns for objects and arrays
  - `content.peggy` - Content patterns for templates, commands, and code
  - `rhs.peggy` - Right-hand side patterns for directive assignments
- âœ… Implemented content-based core handlers in `core/`:
  - `template.peggy` - Template content handling (used by @text, @add)
  - `command.peggy` - Command handling (used by @run, @exec)
  - `code.peggy` - Code block handling (used by @run, @exec)
  - `path.peggy` - Path handling (used by @import, @add)
- âœ… Started directive implementations in `directives/`:
  - `run.peggy` - Run directive for executing commands and code
  - `text.peggy` - Text directive for defining variables
- âœ… Updated build script to handle both old and new grammar structures
- âœ… Created comprehensive documentation in README.md files

### Architecture Changes
- âœ… Switched from directive-based core design to content-based core design
- âœ… Implemented context detection system for @ symbol disambiguation
- âœ… Standardized naming conventions (BaseIdentifier, TemplateCore, etc.)
- âœ… Created consistent structure returns from core handlers
- âœ… Used composition pattern for directive implementations

## Completed Work (Continued)

### Phase 5-6: Directive Implementations
- âœ… Implemented all directive implementations:
  - `run.peggy` - Run directive for executing commands and code
  - `exec.peggy` - For defining executable commands/code
  - `text.peggy` - Text directive for defining variables
  - `data.peggy` - For defining data structures
  - `add.peggy` - For text inclusion
  - `path.peggy` - For path definitions
  - `import.peggy` - For importing from other files
- âœ… Updated meld.peggy.new to use new directive implementations
- âœ… Ensured consistent structure for all directives

### Phase 7-8: Testing and Integration
- ðŸ”„ Test the new grammar with existing unit tests
- ðŸ”„ Update failing tests to match new structure
- ðŸ”„ Validate backward compatibility with existing AST output
- ðŸ”„ Create tests for the new context detection system

## Next Steps

1. Rename meld.peggy.new to meld.peggy for production use
2. Run tests to validate the refactored grammar with npm test
3. Fix any test failures that may occur
4. Address any backward compatibility issues
5. Complete documentation for all components
6. Ensure the build script correctly handles the new structure

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Maintainability**: The refactored grammar has clear separation of concerns and follows a consistent structure.
2. **Reduced Duplication**: Content types are defined once and reused across directives.
3. **Better Context Detection**: The @ symbol disambiguation is now handled by a dedicated system.
4. **Standardized Naming**: Consistent naming conventions make the grammar easier to understand.
5. **Cleaner Composition**: Directives are implemented through composition with core content handlers.

## Future Work

1. Implement a testing framework for grammar components
2. Create visualization tools for the grammar structure
3. Add support for new directive variants (e.g., @text path variants)
4. Further optimize the parsing performance
