# Meld Grammar Audit and Refinement Plan

This document outlines our plan for auditing, refining, and improving the Meld grammar implementation. The primary focus is on ensuring code quality, consistency, and maintainability across the grammar codebase.

## Current Status

We've successfully implemented all core directives with the new structured AST format:
- `text` directive - Complete with template and variable interpolation support
- `path` directive - Complete with structured AST format
- `data` directive - Complete with basic structured format (complex nesting planned)
- `add` directive (renamed from `embed`) - Complete with all subtypes
- `run` directive - Complete with all subtypes 
- `exec` directive (renamed from `define`) - Complete with all subtypes
- `import` directive - Complete with structured AST format

## Audit Plan

We will conduct comprehensive audits of the following areas:

### 1. Grammar Abstractions Audit - DONE (fully implemented)

### 2. Grammar Documentation Audit - DONE (plan doce made)

**Goal**: Ensure complete and accurate documentation for all grammar components.

**IMPORTANT**: Review one document at a time and be 100% evidence based in your review to avoide any hallucination. It's imperative we don't describe features in our docs that do not exist or syntax that doesn't match the implementation.

**Process**:
- Review all directive documentation in directives/*.md
- Verify alignment between documentation and current implementation
- Identify gaps in documentation
- Ensure all subtypes are documented with examples

**Deliverable**: 
- Updated documentation that accurately reflects the current grammar implementation
- Documentation for any missing components

### 3. Code Comments Standardization - DONE (plan doc made)

**Goal**: Design and implement a consistent approach to code comments throughout the grammar.

**Process**:
- Use wrapped-content.peggy as a reference for logic tree documentation
- Implement separators to clearly delineate grammar sections (not overly aggressively)
- Ensure all quote comments (e.g., `TextSegment "Plain text segment"`) have detailed descriptions
- Add explanatory comments for complex grammar rules
- Triple and double check your work for accuracy to avoid hallucination 

**Deliverable**:
- A standardized approach to grammar code comments
- Improved code readability through consistent documentation

### 4. Debugging Cleanup - Plan complete

**Goal**: Remove temporary debugging and standardize necessary debugging.

**Process**:
- Identify and remove unnecessary debugging statements
- Standardize required debugging approaches
- Document best practices for grammar debugging

**Deliverable**:
- Cleaner code with only essential debugging
- Documented approach for adding debugging when needed

### 5. Types Audit

**Goal**: Ensure alignment between type definitions and actual grammar implementation.

**Process**:
- Review all type definitions in grammar/types/
- Verify they match the current grammar implementation
- Identify any misalignments or gaps
- Document findings in `AUDIT-TYPES.md`

**Deliverable**: A document listing:
- Areas where types don't match implementation
- Missing type definitions
- Recommendations for type improvements
- No actual code changes - just audit and documentation

### 6. Tests Audit

**Goal**: Identify test coverage gaps and improvement opportunities.

**Process**:
- Review existing test coverage for all directives
- Identify edge cases not currently tested
- Document potential areas for test improvements
- Review test structure and organization
- Document findings in `AUDIT-TESTS.md`

**Deliverable**: A document listing:
- Areas with insufficient test coverage
- Edge cases that should be tested
- Recommendations for test organization improvements
- No actual code changes - just audit and documentation

## Implementation Priority

1. Grammar Documentation Audit
2. Code Comments Standardization
3. Debugging Cleanup
4. Grammar Abstractions Audit
5. Types Audit
6. Tests Audit

## Next Steps After Audits

Once the audits are complete, we will:

1. Implement the recommendations from each audit
2. Finalize all documentation
3. Conduct a final review of the entire grammar implementation

This phased approach will ensure we maintain high code quality while making incremental improvements to the grammar implementation.
