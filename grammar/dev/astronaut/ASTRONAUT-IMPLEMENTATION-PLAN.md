# Grammar-Driven Development: Implementation Plan

This document outlines the phased implementation plan for creating a grammar-driven development system using the AST Explorer as the core engine driving our type system, test fixtures, and documentation.

## Key Design Decisions

Before implementation, several critical design decisions need to be made:

### 1. Type Generation Strategy

**Decision Needed**: How should we handle the relationship between generated types and manual refinements?

**Options**:
- **Pure Generation**: Auto-generate the entire type system from the AST with no manual editing
- **Skeleton + Refinement**: Generate base types and allow manual refinement in separate files
- **Mixed with Markers**: Single files with special markers for manual additions
- **Two-tier System**: Generated base types with manually defined wrapper types

**Recommendation**: Mixed with Markers approach - generate types into files that use special comment markers to preserve manual additions when regenerating.

### 2. AST-to-Type Mapping Granularity

**Decision Needed**: How closely should types mirror the exact AST structure?

**Options**:
- **Direct 1:1 Mapping**: Types exactly match AST structure with no abstractions
- **Conceptual Mapping**: Types represent the conceptual model with selective AST details
- **Hybrid Approach**: Core structure matches AST but with abstractions for common patterns

**Recommendation**: Hybrid approach - maintain structural alignment with AST while introducing useful abstractions for developers.

### 3. Documentation Format and Integration

**Decision Needed**: How should documentation be integrated with the type system?

**Options**:
- **JSDoc Only**: Rely entirely on TypeScript JSDoc for documentation
- **Separate Markdown**: Generate separate markdown documentation from types
- **Integrated System**: Combined approach with JSDoc, markdown, and examples

**Recommendation**: Integrated system with JSDoc for API docs, markdown for concepts, and examples that showcase both syntax and resulting AST.

### 4. Test Fixture Approach

**Decision Needed**: How should test fixtures be structured?

**Options**:
- **Raw AST Snapshots**: Store raw JSON of complete AST output
- **Focused Test Cases**: Generate specialized test cases for each feature/variant
- **Parameterized Tests**: Create test matrices with variations

**Recommendation**: Implement parameterized tests with focused test cases that can validate specific aspects of the AST structure.
