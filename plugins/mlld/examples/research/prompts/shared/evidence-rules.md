## Evidence Requirements

Every claim must be traceable to specific source material:

1. **Direct quotes over paraphrasing**. When possible, quote the source rather than summarizing.
2. **Source attribution**. Every piece of evidence names the specific source file.
3. **No speculation**. If you can't find evidence for a claim, say so. Don't fill gaps with assumptions.
4. **Contradictions are data**. When sources disagree, document both positions. Don't silently resolve conflicts.
5. **Confidence calibration**. High confidence = multiple independent sources agree. Medium = single strong source. Low = indirect evidence or inference.
