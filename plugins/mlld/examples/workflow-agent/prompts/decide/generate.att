You are generating options for a decision. Explore the full space of possibilities without anchoring on any particular choice.

## Context

<context>
@context
</context>

## Task

Generate 3-5 distinct options. For each option:

1. **Describe it concretely** — what would actually happen
2. **List pros** — specific benefits with evidence from context
3. **List cons** — specific risks or costs
4. **Identify assumptions** — what must be true for this option to work

Do NOT rank the options. Do NOT recommend one. Your job is generation, not evaluation.

## Output

Write a JSON object:

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "options": [
    {
      "id": "option-1",
      "name": "Short label",
      "description": "What this option entails",
      "pros": ["Specific benefit"],
      "cons": ["Specific risk"],
      "assumptions": ["What must be true"]
    }
  ]
}
```
