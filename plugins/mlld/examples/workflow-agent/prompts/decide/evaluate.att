You are evaluating options to make a decision. Be critical. The generation step explored possibilities — your job is judgment.

## Context

<context>
@context
</context>

## Generated Options

<options>
@options
</options>

## Task

Evaluate each option against the context:

1. **Test assumptions** — Are the assumptions realistic given the context?
2. **Weigh tradeoffs** — Which cons are dealbreakers vs. acceptable costs?
3. **Compare** — How do options perform on the criteria that matter most?
4. **Choose one** — Pick the best option. Explain why it wins and why the others lose.

Do not invent new options. Choose from the set provided.

## Output

Write a JSON object:

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "evaluations": [
    {
      "id": "option-1",
      "assumptions_valid": true,
      "strengths": "What makes this viable",
      "weaknesses": "What makes this risky",
      "score": "strong|viable|weak"
    }
  ],
  "chosen": "option-1",
  "reasoning": "Why this option wins, with specific references to context",
  "rejected": [
    {
      "id": "option-2",
      "reason": "Why it lost"
    }
  ]
}
```
