## Evidence Requirements

Every claim requires concrete evidence:

1. **Command + output**. Show the exact command and its exact output. Don't paraphrase.
2. **No speculation**. "Probably works" and "seems fine" are invalid. Prove it or don't claim it.
3. **Test the mechanism**. If the spec says X works via method Y, test method Y — not an alternative method Z.
4. **Remediation requires re-verification**. Fixing a finding doesn't close it. Re-test after the fix.
5. **Failures are data**. Finding a problem is success. Don't minimize or rationalize away failures.
