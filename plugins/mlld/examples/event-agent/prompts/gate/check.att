Does this output adequately address the task? Be strict.

## Task

<task>
Type: @task.type
Description: @task.description
</task>

## Agent Output

<output>
@output
</output>

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Addresses the task**: Does the output actually respond to what was asked?
2. **Substantive**: Does it contain real content, not just acknowledgment or filler?
3. **Complete**: Are all parts of the task addressed, or is it partial?

If the output is empty, generic, or doesn't address the specific task, fail it.

## Output

```json

  "pass": true,

Or if rejecting:

```json
{
  "pass": false,
  "feedback": "Specific reason for rejection and what needs to improve"
}
```
