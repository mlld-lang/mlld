Which agent should handle this task? Score each agent's fit.

## Task

<task>
Type: @task.type
Description: @task.description
</task>

## Available Agents

@agents

## Instructions

For each agent, score how well it matches the task (high/medium/low/none). Pick the best match.

If the task clearly matches one agent's capabilities, set confidence to "high". If multiple agents could handle it, set confidence to "low" — a second-pass classifier will refine the decision.

## Output

Write a JSON object:

```json
{
  "agent": "agent-id",
  "confidence": "high|medium|low",
  "reasoning": "Why this agent is the best fit"
}
```
