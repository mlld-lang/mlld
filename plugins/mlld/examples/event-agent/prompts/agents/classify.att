3. **Tags**: 2-5 relevant labels for routing and filtering
4. **Summary**: One-sentence description of what needs to happen

## Output

Write a JSON object:

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "task_id": "@task.id",
  "category": "engineering",
  "urgency": "normal",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
  "summary": "What this task requires"
}
```
