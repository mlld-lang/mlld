Actions like /${ACTION} cannot be used in /exe when expressions

/exe functions must return values, not perform actions:
  ✗ /exe @${FUNCNAME}() = when: [ condition => /${ACTION} "text" ]
  ✅ /exe @${FUNCNAME}() = when: [ condition => "text" ]

To perform actions, use /when at the directive level:
  /when: [ condition => /${ACTION} "text" ]
