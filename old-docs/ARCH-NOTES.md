4. Migrate existing tests to new infrastructure

Focus areas:
- Start with `tests/__mocks__/setup.ts`
- Create `src/interpreter/__tests__/test-utils.ts`
- Update all test files to use new infrastructure
- Add comprehensive test coverage

Important considerations:
- Maintain backward compatibility

  - Standardized error creation across handlers
  - Ensured proper location context preservation
  - Added comprehensive error-specific tests
  - Updated all directive handlers
  - Added integration tests for nested scenarios
  - Fixed type safety in error handling

- Phase 4 (Test Infrastructure) üöß IN PROGRESS
  - Base test utilities exist but need enhancement
  - Some mock implementations exist
  - Need comprehensive test context
  - Need handler context utilities

### Next Steps (Phase 4)
The next Claude instance should focus on implementing the Test Infrastructure. Key objectives:

1. TestContext Implementation:
   - Create new TestContext class for test setup/teardown
   - Add utilities for common test scenarios
   - Support both top-level and nested testing
   - Add mock file system support

2. Mock Implementations:
   - Create mock file system
   - Create mock state implementation
   - Add utilities for creating test nodes
   - Support location tracking in mocks

3. Handler Context Utilities:
   - Create utilities for handler testing
   - Support both modes (top-level/right-side)
   - Add location adjustment helpers
   - Support state inheritance testing

4. Test Migration:
   - Update existing tests to use new infrastructure
   - Add more comprehensive test coverage
   - Verify all edge cases
   - Add nested scenario tests

Files to modify:
- `tests/__mocks__/setup.ts`
- `src/interpreter/__tests__/test-utils.ts` (new)
- All test files

Important Considerations:
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing tests
- Ensure proper cleanup between tests
- Add comprehensive documentation
- Consider test performance

## Context and Background
This document outlines a comprehensive plan to fix critical issues in the Meld interpreter's implementation, particularly around state inheritance and location handling. The work has been broken down into phases that can be implemented by separate Claude instances.

### Current State
- The codebase has partially implemented a right-side operation refactor
- Tests are failing, particularly around nested directive handling
- Key issues include state inheritance, location adjustments, and error handling
- Core infrastructure components (LocationManager, ErrorFactory, TestContext) are missing or incomplete

### Key Issues
1. State inheritance is not working correctly in nested directives
2. Location adjustments are inconsistent and sometimes incorrect
3. Error handling lacks proper location context
4. Test infrastructure needs improvement for handling complex scenarios

### Implementation Strategy
- Work is divided into 4 phases
= Take your time with each step. Thoroughness is more important than speed.
- Each phase is designed to be handled by a fresh Claude instance
- Phases have clear dependencies and deliverables
- Changes are atomic and focused
- Tests are updated alongside implementation
- Verify each change with tests before moving to the next step.
- Keep detailed notes of your changes to assist the next Claude.
- If you encounter edge cases or unclear requirements, pause and ask for clarification.

When you complete your work:
- Run the tests. 
- Document all changes made in this file.
- Note any challenges or unexpected behaviors
- Write a handoff note for the next Claude who will implement the next phase
- Include suggestions for the advanced features based on your experience with the core implementation

### Success Criteria (of the full refactor)
- All tests pass, particularly nested directive tests
- State inheritance works correctly across multiple levels
- Location information is accurate in both normal operation and errors
- Test infrastructure supports both top-level and right-side testing scenarios

   - List of files to modify
4. Each Claude should:
   - Review existing code before making changes
   - Make atomic, focused changes
   - Add detailed comments explaining changes
   - Update tests as needed

---

Below is a complete plan to address the top two (related) issues in this codebase‚Äînamely, (1) fixing sub-interpreter state inheritance and nested directive handling, and (2) ensuring location adjustments (for both interpreted content and errors) are handled correctly. The plan begins with what we will change, then provides exact line-by-line patches for the most complex files involved (primarily subInterpreter.ts and state.ts, with one test fix in nested-directives.test.ts).

High-Level Plan
	1.	Fix Sub-Interpreter State Inheritance and Nested Directive Handling
	‚Ä¢	Ensure that the InterpreterState supports partial or full inheritance of parent state variables (text, data, commands, etc.).
	‚Ä¢	Clarify how changes made in the child state merge back to the parent state. By design, some code already suggests we do mergeChildState(childState) in subInterpreter.ts, but that logic is incomplete or references inexistent methods (like getLocalTextVars()).
	‚Ä¢	Add (or correct) methods in InterpreterState to track only what changed locally, so that merges do not re-run every variable from scratch if we only want to merge partial changes. If a simpler approach is acceptable, we can merge the entire child‚Äôs state to the parent so that all child modifications become visible to the parent.
	2.	Fix Location Adjustments in Nested Directives
	‚Ä¢	Ensure that every node‚Äôs location object is properly offset by the baseLocation whenever we parse nested content in interpretSubDirectives.
	‚Ä¢	When an error occurs in nested directives, ensure we attach the adjusted location in the thrown error so test suites can confirm correct line/column references.
	‚Ä¢	Add (or fix) test coverage for nested location offsets with multi-line content, verifying we correctly handle line increments for everything past the first line.
	3.	Implement Additional/Corrected Tests
	‚Ä¢	In nested-directives.test.ts or subInterpreter.test.ts, add or fix a test that explicitly checks the final line/column of a multi-line nested directive is correct, so we can be sure our location arithmetic is accurate.

Detailed Steps and Code Changes

Below are explicit file-by-file code changes. All patches assume your repository structure is unchanged from the code you provided. You can apply these line-by-line diffs (or merge them manually) to implement the fixes.

	Note: Any line numbers in these diffs are illustrative. You may need to adjust them if your local file differs. However, the code snippets should be appended exactly as shown where indicated.

1. src/interpreter/state/state.ts (or wherever InterpreterState class is defined)

Goal: Fix or add methods needed for partial merges, and ensure merges do not break child/parent state references.

Explanation:
	‚Ä¢	We introduce mergeChildState(childState) to unify child modifications into the parent.
	‚Ä¢	We add setImmutable() and an isImmutable getter. Now a child state can be ‚Äúlocked‚Äù after merging, preventing further modifications.
	‚Ä¢	We clarify how a state can hold parentState (passed to the constructor) and optionally retrieve it with getParentState().

2. src/interpreter/subInterpreter.ts

Goal: Properly adjust node locations for sub-directives, ensure correct merges to parent, handle the base location across multi-line content, and lock child state if needed.

Explanation:
	‚Ä¢	We set the new childState to inherit the parent file path, ensuring relative path-based logic is consistent.
	‚Ä¢	We remove the redundant loop that was adding nodes to the child state before interpret() if interpret() is already adding them. (We only do one or the other to avoid duplication.)
	‚Ä¢	We ensure a consistent while-loop merges child state up the entire chain of parents (stopping if any parent is immutable).
	‚Ä¢	We added a console.log tweak for clarity.

3. src/interpreter/state/state.ts (Optional Addendum)

If your code references setCurrentFilePath or getCurrentFilePath inside InterpreterState (some code in importDirectiveHandler suggests it), you need to add these. If you already have them, ignore this patch.

4. test/interpreter/nested-directives.test.ts (or similarly named)

Goal: Fix or add a test to confirm location offsets on a multi-line nested directive. If the test is missing or references broken location logic, we add a test that fails unless location is properly adjusted.

Below is an example minimal fix: suppose you have a test block named "should handle location offsets correctly". We add an assertion verifying that the final line/column is also correct.

+        end: { line: 8, column: 10 }
+      };
+      // Additional content or directives that occupy multiple lines...
+    });
   });

</details>


Then fill in the test content as needed. The crucial fix is verifying that location.end.line is offset by baseLocation.start.line - 1.

5. Optional: Add a new failing test for subInterpreter if you suspect we do not have test coverage for partial merges.

You can do something like:

it('should only merge child state once and preserve unique data from the parent', () => {
  // ...
});

Make it fail if the child‚Äôs changes vanish or if parent is re-written incorrectly.

Final Recap
	1.	State: We add mergeChildState and ‚Äúimmutability‚Äù to unify child changes with the parent and freeze the child once done.
	2.	Sub-interpreter: We fix location adjustments, remove double-adding of nodes, unify the while-loop merging approach, and keep consistent file path references.
	3.	Tests: We extend or correct tests to confirm multi-line location offsets and ensure child merges are correct.

With these changes, nested directives will now properly inherit the parent‚Äôs variables, generate correct line/column offsets for errors, and propagate newly created or updated data/text vars back to the entire parent chain‚Äîconsistent with your codebase vision for maintainability, testability, clarity, and functionality.

This completes the explicit plan and patch-level instructions needed to resolve the key outstanding refactor and integration issues.
