# Mlld Language

Mlld (pronounced "meld") is a prompt scripting language for assembling dynamic context. It's embedded in Markdown, making prompts readable as documentation and executable as code.

## What is Mlld?

Mlld lets you:
- Build reusable context modules
- Import and compose prompts from files and URLs
- Execute commands and embed their output
- Apply templates and transformations
- Create dynamic, conditional content

## Example

```mlld
@import { guidelines, examples } from "./context.mld"
@path docs = "./documentation"

@run [ls {{docs}}]

@text prompt = [[
Based on these guidelines:
{{guidelines}}

And these examples:
{{examples}}

Please help me with the following task...

@add @prompt
```
