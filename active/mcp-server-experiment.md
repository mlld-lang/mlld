# MCP Server Experiment for Custom Resolvers

## Overview

Create an experimental Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to validate using MCP as the communication protocol for external custom resolvers.

## Core Concept

Build a proof-of-concept MCP server that demonstrates custom resolver communication:

- Simple file system resolver server using MCP protocol
- Validate communication between mlld and external MCP resolver
- Measure performance characteristics and developer experience
- Establish MCP protocol specification for resolver operations

Goals: Prove MCP viability, define protocol, test integration, assess performance.

## Dependencies

- MCP protocol implementation
- Basic resolver architecture from main implementation phases
