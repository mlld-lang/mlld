Made progress but hit architectural issues with the fixture builder.\n\n## Completed Work\n\n### 1. Closed Issues\n- **mlld-dk5**: Fixed @var_key → .mx.key in 4 files (reference.md, flow-control.md, ITERATORS.md, INTERPRETER.md)\n- **mlld-5y6**: Fixed parallel pipeline docs that incorrectly said 'JSON array string' - now correctly says 'StructuredValue array'\n\n### 2. Removed from Epic\n- mlld-i484, mlld-f29r, mlld-7oa - not doc-related per adam\n\n### 3. Fixture Builder Updates (mlld-21gy - IN PROGRESS)\nUpdated `scripts/extract-doc-tests.mjs`:\n- Added `looksLikeDirective()` function to detect both `/var` and `var` style directives\n- Added support for `\\`\\`\\`mlld` (strict) vs `\\`\\`\\`mlld:md` (markdown) fences  \n- Changed output to generate `example.mld` for strict mode, `example.md` for markdown mode\n- Updated `cleanDirectory()` to handle both extensions\n\n## Current Problem\n\nThe fixture builder changes work, but 99 doc tests now fail because:\n\n1. Current docs use `\\`\\`\\`mlld` fence (treated as strict mode now)\n2. But docs contain `#` comment lines like `# Use helpers in tests`\n3. In strict mode (.mld), `#` is prose, not a comment - causes parse error\n4. mlld uses `\u003e\u003e` for comments in strict mode\n\n**Error example:**\n```\nParse Error: Text content not allowed in strict mode (.mld)\nLocation: Line 1, Column 43\nContext: # Use helpers in tests\n```\n\n## Key Insight from Adam\n\n\u003e \"/var does NOT error in strict mode. Strict mode is about not allowing prose. You can use / or not in .mld files -- mlld doesn't care.\"\n\nSo the real distinction is:\n- **.mld (strict)**: No prose allowed, `\u003e\u003e` comments, bare OR slashed directives work\n- **.mld.md (markdown)**: Prose becomes output, `#` comments work, must use `/` prefix\n\n## Remaining Work\n\n### Option A: Smart mode detection (quick fix)\nAdd logic to treat blocks with `#` comment lines as markdown mode automatically. This preserves current docs behavior while the builder is updated.\n\n### Option B: Update docs first (proper fix)\n1. Convert `#` comments to `\u003e\u003e` comments in docs\n2. Remove `/` prefixes from directives (except inside template loops where `/for` is required)\n3. Mark prose-containing blocks as `\\`\\`\\`mlld:md`\n\n## Files Changed This Session\n- `scripts/extract-doc-tests.mjs` - Updated for strict/markdown mode detection\n- `docs/user/reference.md` - .mx.key fix\n- `docs/user/flow-control.md` - .mx.key fix + parallel pipeline fix\n- `docs/dev/ITERATORS.md` - .mx.key fix + parallel pipeline fix  \n- `docs/dev/INTERPRETER.md` - .mx.key fix\n\n## Open Issues in Epic (mlld-53mk)\n- mlld-04k: Docs: alternative syntax guide [P2]\n- mlld-5d2: Clarify template vs module imports [P2]\n- mlld-9qq: Audit strict vs markdown defaults [P2]\n- mlld-vlw: Update docs for strict mode [P2] ← main work\n- mlld-21gy: Update fixture builder [P1] ← blocking\n\n## Commands to Resume\n```bash\nbd show mlld-53mk     # Epic overview\nbd show mlld-21gy     # Fixture builder issue (in_progress)\nbd show mlld-vlw      # Main docs update issue\n\n# Test current state\nnpm run build:fixtures\nnpm test -- --run --testNamePattern=\"docs/\"\n```\n\n## Template Loop Gotcha\nInside `::..::` template blocks, for loops REQUIRE the `/` prefix:\n```mlld\nvar @msg = ::\n/for @x in @items\n- @x\n/end\n::\n```\nThis is why naive find-replace of all `/for` → `for` breaks things.","mentions":[],"message_type":"agent","reply_to":null,"ts":1767424853,"edited_at":null,"archived_at":null}

No prose allowed. Comments use `\u003e\u003e`\n- **Markdown mode**: Prose becomes output. Directives need `/` prefix. Comments can use `#`\n\n**The docs were all written for markdown mode but we're converting to strict mode as the default.**\n\n### Key Syntax Rules for Strict Mode\n\n1. **Bare directives**: `var @x = 1` not `/var @x = 1`\n2. **Comments**: `\u003e\u003e comment` not `# comment`\n3. **Commands are typed**: `cmd {...}`, `sh {...}`, `js {...}` - NOT `run {...}`\n4. **Template loops REQUIRE slash**: Inside `::...::` and backtick templates, use `/for` and `/end`\n\n### Streaming Syntax (Important - was wrong in docs)\n- **Define streaming exe**: `exe @func() = stream cmd {...}`\n- **Invoke with stream**: `stream @func()` or `run stream sh {...}`\n- There is NO `stream exe @func() = ...` syntax\n\n## What We Accomplished\n\n1. Updated `scripts/extract-doc-tests.mjs` to support `\\`\\`\\`mlld` (strict) vs `\\`\\`\\`mlld:md` (markdown)\n2. Converted most user docs to strict mode:\n   - Replaced `/var`, `/show`, etc. with bare directives\n   - Replaced `# comment` with `\u003e\u003e comment` inside code blocks\n   - Fixed template loops to use `/for`\n3. Rewrote streaming.md with correct syntax\n4. Converted non-runnable syntax examples to tables\n5. Added skip files for edge cases\n\n## Test Status\n\nStarted at 99 failures, got down to ~10 before session ended. Run:\n```bash\nnpm run build:fixtures \u0026\u0026 npm test -- --run\n```\n\n## Files Changed\n- All docs in `docs/user/*.md`\n- `scripts/extract-doc-tests.mjs`\n- Added skip files in `tests/cases/docs/*/`\n- Created `tmp/convert-docs.mjs` (conversion script)\n\n## Issues Created This Session\n- **mlld-8jer**: Import version syntax `@module@version` not parsing (P2 bug)\n\n## Remaining Work\n\n### mlld-21gy (fixture builder) - nearly done\nJust needs final test pass verification\n\n### mlld-vlw (docs strict mode) - in progress\n- Fix remaining ~10 test failures\n- Some are syntax reference blocks that show patterns but aren't runnable\n- Add skip files or convert to tables as needed\n\n### mlld-04k (alternative syntax guide) - not started\nCreate `docs/user/alternative-syntax.md` covering:\n- Markdown mode (`.mld.md` files)\n- `with {...}` clause (verbose alternative)\n- `:::..::` escape hatch templates\n- When to use which mode\n\n### New doc needed: docs/user/markdown.md\nExplain markdown/prose mode as the alternative to strict mode\n\n## Commands to Resume\n```bash\nbd show mlld-53mk     # Epic overview\nbd show mlld-21gy     # Fixture builder (in_progress)\nbd show mlld-vlw      # Main docs update (in_progress)\n\nnpm run build:fixtures\nnpm test -- --run 2\u003e\u00261 | grep 'FAIL.*docs'  # See remaining failures\n```\n\n## Gotcha: Template Loops\nThe conversion script `tmp/convert-docs.mjs` strips slashes from ALL directives.
