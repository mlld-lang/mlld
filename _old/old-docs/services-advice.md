I've reviewed the codebase comprehensively and agree this is a good time for architectural improvements. Let's analyze the key areas of complexity and consider how to better isolate them.

Current Complexity Points:
1. Path/filesystem handling (partially addressed with PathService)
2. Circular import detection (currently scattered)
3. State management and inheritance
4. Variable resolution and interpolation
5. Directive validation and error handling
6. Test infrastructure and mocking

Proposed Architectural Improvements:

### 1. Service Layer Isolation

Each major concern should be extracted into its own service:

```
Services/
  PathService/        (existing)
  CircularityService/ (new)
  StateService/       (new)
  ValidationService/  (new)
  InterpolationService/ (new)
  FileSystemService/    (new)
```

This would make each piece independently testable and maintainable.

### 2. Clear Domain Boundaries

The codebase currently mixes concerns. We should establish clear domains:

```
Core/
  - Core types and interfaces
  - Base error classes
  - Common utilities

Directives/
  - Pure directive logic
  - No direct file/path handling
  - Delegates to services

Services/
  - Implementation of complex features
  - Stateful services where needed
  - Clear interfaces

Infrastructure/
  - File system abstraction
  - Logging
  - Configuration
```

### 3. Testing Improvements

Current test issues stem from:
- Too much mocking
- Complex test setup
- Brittle file system tests

Suggested improvements:
1. Create a TestContext that encapsulates all test dependencies
2. Use more focused unit tests with clear boundaries
3. Separate integration tests for file system operations
4. Create test helpers for common scenarios

### 4. Error Handling

Current error handling is scattered. Propose:
1. Define clear error hierarchies
2. Centralize error creation
3. Add context to errors at each layer
4. Make errors more traceable

### 5. State Management

The current state management is complex. Consider:
1. Making state immutable
2. Using a reducer pattern
3. Clear state inheritance rules
4. Better isolation of state changes

### 6. Interface-First Design

For each major component:
1. Define clear interfaces
2. Document expected behaviors
3. Make dependencies explicit
4. Use dependency injection

### Key Recommendations:

1. **FileSystemService**
- Abstract all fs operations
- Handle path resolution
- Manage file access patterns
- Centralize mocking strategy

2. **ValidationService**
- Handle all directive validation
- Consistent error messages
- Reusable validation rules
- Clear validation contexts

3. **StateService**
- Manage state inheritance
- Handle variable resolution
- Track state changes
- Support immutability

4. **CircularityService**
- Track import chains
- Detect cycles
- Support different detection strategies
- Clear reporting

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these areas? Or should we focus on a specific aspect first?

These changes would make the system more maintainable, testable, and easier to understand. We can tackle them incrementally, starting with the most impactful areas.
