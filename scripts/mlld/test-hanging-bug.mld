# Test Case: Reproduce hanging bug

## Load file with wrong relative path (missing @base/)
/var @contract = <docs/dev/DATA.md>

## Show if we got here (we shouldn't)
/show "ERROR: Execution continued after file load failure!"
/show "Contract value: @contract"

## Try to use in parallel loop
/exe @testCmd(data) = {echo "Got data: @data"}

/var @items = ["a", "b", "c"]
/var @results = for parallel @item in @items => @testCmd(@contract)

/show "Results: @results"
