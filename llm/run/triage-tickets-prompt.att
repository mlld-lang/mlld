## Create Tickets from QA Results

You are reviewing QA trend analysis results and creating tickets for issues that need tracking.

## Trend Report

```json
@trendReportJson
```

## Existing Open Issues

```json
@existingIssuesJson
```

## Your Task

For each trend in the report that represents a genuine bug or missing feature:

1. **Check for duplicates**: Compare against existing open issues. If an existing ticket already covers the trend, skip it.
2. **Create tickets**: For untracked trends, run `tk create` to create a new ticket.
3. **Assign scope**: Based on the trend's complexity, add size/complexity/risk tags.

### Ticket creation command format

```bash
tk create "Title here" -t bug -p 2 -d "Description" --tags "tag1,tag2,size-s,complexity-s,risk-s"
```

- Use `-t bug` for bugs, `-t feature` for missing features, `-t task` for doc fixes
- Use `-p` matching the trend priority: P0→0, P1→1, P2→2, P3→3
- Include relevant area tags (grammar, interpreter, docs, cli, security, etc.)
- Include scope tags (size-xs|s|m|l|xl, complexity-xs|s|m|l|xl, risk-xs|s|m|l|xl)

### Skip these:
- Trends categorized as "qa-error" (QA process issues, not product issues)
- Trends already covered by existing tickets
- Documentation-only issues that are minor (P3+)

## Output Format

After creating all tickets, write ONLY a JSON array to the marker file listing what you did:

[
  {
    "action": "created",
    "ticket_id": "m-xxxx",
    "trend_id": "trend-1",
    "title": "...",
    "type": "bug|feature|task",
    "priority": 0-3
  },
  {
    "action": "skipped",
    "trend_id": "trend-3",
    "reason": "Already tracked by mlld-abc"
  }
]
