## Apply Fix in Isolated Worktree

You are applying a verified fix to the mlld codebase using git worktrees for isolation.

## Instructions

### 1. Create Worktree

Create an isolated worktree for this fix. First clean up any existing worktree from a failed previous attempt:

```bash
# Remove existing worktree if present (from previous failed run)
wt remove polish/@topic-@experiment -y 2>/dev/null || true

# Create fresh worktree
wt switch --create polish/@topic-@experiment --base @baseBranch -y
```

You are now in the worktree. All file operations happen here, isolated from main.
Verify you're in the worktree:

```bash
pwd
git branch --show-current
```

### 2. Code Changes

For each item in code_changes:
- Read the file first to understand current state
- Apply the change as specified
- If the code has diverged, adapt the fix to current state

### 3. Test Fixture (REQUIRED)

Create the test fixture from test_changes:
- Create the fixture_dir directory
- Create example.md with the mlld input code
- Create expected.md with expected output
- Run: `npm run build:fixtures`

Note: Support file names must be unique across all tests (prefix with test name).

### 4. CHANGELOG.md Entry (REQUIRED)

Add entry to CHANGELOG.md:
- Find the topmost version section (e.g., `## [2.0.0-rc82]`)
- Add under the appropriate subsection (`### Fixed`, `### Added`, `### Changed`)
- Use the changelog_entry text from the fix
- Create subsection if it doesn't exist

### 5. Documentation Updates

If doc_changes is not empty:
- Edit each atom file specified
- Make the described change
- Only edit atoms in `docs/src/atoms/` (never `docs/llm/*.txt` directly)

### 6. Build and Test

```bash
npm run build
npm test
```

Record whether tests pass or fail.

### 7. Commit in Worktree

If tests pass:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix(@topic): <brief description from fix>"
```

If tests fail, still commit so we can inspect:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "WIP: fix(@topic): <brief description> [tests failing]"
```

Get the commit SHA:
```bash
git rev-parse HEAD
```

### 8. Write Result

Write fixed.json to the QA directory (NOT the worktree). The QA directory is: @experimentDir

```json
{
  "topic": "@topic",
  "experiment": "@experiment",
  "applied": true,
  "verified": <true if all tests pass, false otherwise>,
  "worktree_branch": "polish/@topic-@experiment",
  "test_fixture": "<path to created fixture>",
  "changelog_added": true,
  "docs_updated": <true if doc_changes were applied, false if empty>,
  "commit_sha": "<sha from git rev-parse HEAD>",
  "errors": []
}
```

If there were errors, populate the errors array with descriptions.

### 9. Return to Main

Switch back to the base branch:

```bash
wt switch @baseBranch
```

## Important Notes

- All code changes happen in the worktree, NOT the main repo
- fixed.json goes to @experimentDir (in main repo's qa/ dir)
- The worktree will be merged later by a separate merge phase
- Even if tests fail, commit and write fixed.json so we can inspect
- Do NOT delete the worktree - the merge phase will handle that
