## Quality Bar: Medium Polish

This run uses medium polish (`--polish med`). Higher standards apply.

### Additional Requirements

5. Edge cases must be handled - the implementation should work for reasonable variations, not just the happy path
6. Documentation must be accurate - if the final review finds documentation/implementation mismatches, fix them before completion
7. Error messages must be helpful - users should understand what went wrong and how to fix it
8. The final review rating must be at least "adequate" (not "narrow" or "broken")

### Before Completing

Ask yourself: "Would a new user succeed with this feature based on the documentation alone?"

If the answer is "mostly, but they might get confused by X" - fix X first. Medium polish means shipping quality work, not just passing tests.
