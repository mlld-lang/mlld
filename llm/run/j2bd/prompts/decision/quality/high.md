## Quality Bar: High Polish

This run uses high polish (`--polish high`). Excellence is the target.

### Rating Requirements

**Final review must rate the work as "solid" or better** before proceeding to excellence assessment. If final review rates it as only "adequate", create tickets to address the gaps and iterate until you achieve "solid".

High polish is for features that represent the project. Adequate is not acceptable.

### Additional Requirements

9. After final review approves with "solid" or better rating, create an excellence assessment ticket and dispatch a worker to evaluate the end-to-end user experience
10. Polish gaps must be addressed:
    - Examples should be clear and self-contained
    - Error messages should guide users to solutions
    - Common mistakes should be caught with helpful warnings
    - The "getting started" experience should be smooth
11. If the excellence assessment finds fundamental gaps (requiring major work), use the "blocked" action to ask the human whether to:
    - Accept current quality and complete
    - Expand scope to address the gaps
    - Fix only polish gaps and complete

### Before Completing

Ask yourself: "Would this feature delight a new user? Would they recommend it to others?"

If the answer is "it works, but it's not great" - that's not high polish. Either fix the gaps or block with a clear question about scope.

High polish is for features that represent the project. Ship something you're proud of.
