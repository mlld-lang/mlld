## Quality Bar: High Polish

This run uses high polish (`--polish high`). Excellence is the target.

### Additional Requirements

9. After final review approves, create an excellence assessment ticket and dispatch a worker to evaluate the end-to-end user experience
10. Polish gaps must be addressed:
    - Examples should be clear and self-contained
    - Error messages should guide users to solutions
    - Common mistakes should be caught with helpful warnings
    - The "getting started" experience should be smooth
11. If the excellence assessment finds fundamental gaps (requiring major work), use the "blocked" action to ask the human whether to:
    - Accept current quality and complete
    - Expand scope to address the gaps
    - Fix only polish gaps and complete

### Before Completing

Ask yourself: "Would this feature delight a new user? Would they recommend it to others?"

If the answer is "it works, but it's not great" - that's not high polish. Either fix the gaps or block with a clear question about scope.

High polish is for features that represent the project. Ship something you're proud of.
