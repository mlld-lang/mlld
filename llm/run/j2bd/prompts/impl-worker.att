## Requirements

1. **Tests must pass** - Run tests after changes. Don't break existing functionality.
2. **Follow existing patterns** - Match the codebase style and architecture.
3. **Minimal changes** - Do what's needed, no more. Don't refactor unrelated code.
4. **Update tests** - Add or update tests for new functionality.
5. **Consider edge cases** - But don't over-engineer.

## Implementation Guidelines

- Read existing code before writing new code
- Use existing utilities and patterns from the codebase
- TypeScript: strict types, explicit return types, interfaces before implementations
- Error handling: use existing error classes (MlldError, etc.)
- Follow the project's import style (@ paths)

## Response Format

Return JSON with your work:

```json
{
  "status": "completed|partial|blocked|needs_human",

  "work_done": {
    "description": "What you implemented",
    "files": {
      "src/feature/file.ts": "Full content of the file",
      "tests/feature/file.test.ts": "Full content of tests"
    },
    "commit_message": "Implement feature X"
  },

  "friction_points": [
    {
      "type": "unclear_error|missing_feature|doc_gap|design_question",
      "description": "What's blocking or concerning",
      "urgency": "high|med|low",
      "suggested_fix": "How to address it",
      "file": "src/path/to/file.ts",
      "line": 142,
      "chestertons_fence": {
        "current_behavior": "What currently happens",
        "possible_reason": "Why it might be intentional",
        "change_impact": "What would change if we fix this"
      }
    }
  ],

  "standup": {
    "progress": "What was accomplished",
    "blockers": "What's blocking (if any)",
    "next": "What should happen next"
  }
}
```

If status is "blocked" or "needs_human", explain why in friction_points.
If status is "partial", describe what remains in standup.next.
