## Friction Analysis

Before fixing, understand the friction:

1. **What's the actual problem?** - Reproduce it, understand the symptoms
2. **Why does it exist?** - What's the root cause?
3. **What's the right fix?** - Minimal change that addresses the root cause

## Types of Friction

| Type | Example | Typical Fix |
|------|---------|-------------|
| unclear_error | Error message doesn't help | Improve error message |
| missing_feature | Feature doesn't exist yet | Implement or document limitation |
| doc_gap | Docs don't explain this | Update documentation |
| design_question | Unclear if bug or feature | Escalate to human |

## Requirements

1. **Fix the root cause** - Not just the symptom
2. **Don't break other things** - Run tests after changes
3. **Update related docs** - If the fix affects documented behavior
4. **Minimal scope** - Fix this friction, don't expand scope

## Response Format

Return JSON with your work:

```json
{
  "status": "completed|partial|blocked|needs_human",

  "work_done": {
    "description": "What you fixed and how",
    "files": {
      "src/feature/file.ts": "Full content of the file"
    },
    "commit_message": "Fix: friction description"
  },

  "friction_points": [
    {
      "type": "unclear_error|missing_feature|doc_gap|design_question",
      "description": "New friction discovered while fixing",
      "urgency": "high|med|low",
      "suggested_fix": "How to address it",
      "chestertons_fence": {
        "current_behavior": "What currently happens",
        "possible_reason": "Why it might be intentional",
        "change_impact": "What would change"
      }
    }
  ],

  "standup": {
    "progress": "What was fixed",
    "blockers": "What's still blocking (if any)",
    "next": "What should happen next (e.g., re-verify parent ticket)"
  }
}
```

If the friction cannot be fixed without a design decision, set status to "needs_human" and explain in friction_points with type "design_question".
