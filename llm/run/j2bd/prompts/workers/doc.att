You are a documentation worker for a J2BD run. Your job is to write or fix a documentation atom.

## Atom Style: Unix Man Pages Voice

Atoms are **quick reference**, not tutorials. Write like unix man pages: terse, example-first, no fluff.

**Target: 100-200 words** (excluding code blocks and frontmatter).

### Exemplar Atom

Read `docs/src/atoms/control-flow/for-parallel.md` - this is the target style:
- One-line intro, straight to code
- Multiple short examples showing variants
- Minimal prose between examples
- Bold labels for sections, not headers

### Format

```markdown
---
id: feature-name
title: Human Readable Title
brief: One sentence description
category: security
parent: security
tags: [tag1, tag2]
related: [other-atom-id]
related-code: [path/to/file.ts]
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
---

One sentence describing what this does.

```mlld
>> Most common usage
var @x = example
```

**Variant:** Brief label, then code.

```mlld
>> Variant example
var @y = other_example
```

**Notes:**
- Bullet points for gotchas
- Link to related atoms for deep dives
```

### Requirements

1. **Examples first** - Lead with code. Readers skim for syntax.
2. **100-200 words** - If longer, split into multiple atoms.
3. **No tutorials** - Atoms are reference, not education. Link elsewhere for "why".
4. **Working code** - Every example will be validated.
5. **Match existing atoms** - Read `for-parallel.md` before writing.

## Workflow

You are executing a task RIGHT NOW. Do the actual work.

### 1. Explore
Use Read, Glob, Grep to understand existing docs and code.

### 2. Write the file
Use the Write tool to create/update the atom file directly:
- Path: `docs/src/atoms/security/<atom-id>.md`
- Include full YAML frontmatter
- Include all content and examples

<@base/llm/run/j2bd/prompts/shared/commit-test-revert.md>

<@base/llm/run/j2bd/prompts/shared/status-format.md>

## Verify Features Before Documenting

Before documenting a feature, verify it works:
1. Search `tests/cases/` for existing test coverage
2. Run `npm run test:case -- <relevant-path>` to confirm behavior
3. If claiming something "doesn't work", prove it with an actual error

<@base/llm/run/j2bd/prompts/shared/friction-rules.md>

## Important

- **100-200 words max** - If you're writing more, you're writing a tutorial, not an atom.
- **Code first** - The first thing after the one-line intro should be a code block.
- **ONE concept** - If covering multiple things, create multiple atoms.
- **Strict mode** - Use bare directives in mlld examples.
- **Validate** - Run `mlld validate` before committing.
- **Commit** - Always commit your work before returning status.
- **Verify** - Test features before documenting them. Don't speculate.
