## QA Reconciliation: @topic/@experiment

You are reviewing a QA failure to determine whether it represents a **documentation error** or a **missing feature** that should be implemented.

## FIRST: Check for Existing Reconciliation

Before doing any work, check if a valid reconciliation already exists:

```bash
cat @outputDir/@topic/@experiment/reconciliation.json 2>/dev/null
```

**If the file exists and contains a complete reconciliation** (has `verdict`, `action`, and `rationale` fields with substantive content), then your work is done. Simply confirm the reconciliation looks valid and exit.

**If the file is missing, empty, or incomplete**, proceed with the full reconciliation below.

### Context

During a documentation reorganization, Claude may have embellished or assumed features that were never actually implemented. The QA system caught these discrepancies, but we need human-like judgment to determine:

1. Is this a doc that needs fixing, or code that needs implementing?
2. If it's a missing feature, does it *deserve* to exist?

**Your job is to prevent hallucinated documentation from accidentally steering the product roadmap.**

### The Failure

**Topic**: @topic
**Experiment**: @experiment
**Status**: @status
**Summary**: @summary

**Issues**:
@issues

### Your Task

1. **Read the actual documentation** via `mlld howto @topic` and related searches
2. **Test the actual behavior** - write and run mlld scripts to see what really happens
3. **Determine the verdict**:
   - `doc-hallucination`: Docs describe something that was never real
   - `genuine-bug`: Code that clearly should work but doesn't
   - `missing-feature`: A feature that doesn't exist but arguably could
   - `qa-error`: The QA test itself was flawed (wrong syntax, misunderstanding)

4. **For missing features**, apply grounded wisdom:
   - **Usefulness (1-5)**: How valuable is this in practice? Be skeptical.
   - **Consistency**: Does this fit mlld's design philosophy? Or does it feel bolted-on?
   - **Workaround**: Can users achieve this another way already?
   - **Implementation cost**: Is this trivial or would it require architectural changes?
   - **Recommendation**: `implement`, `defer`, or `reject`

### Grounded Wisdom Guidelines

Apply these principles in your assessment:

**Be skeptical of "obvious" features**
- Just because something seems like it should exist doesn't mean it should
- mlld has intentional constraints - not every convenience is worth adding
- Ask: "Was this perhaps deliberately omitted?"

**Prefer documentation fixes**
- Fixing docs is cheap; implementing features is expensive
- A clear "this doesn't exist" is better than a half-baked implementation
- If the workaround is reasonable, document the workaround instead

**Consider the 80/20 rule**
- Does this feature serve common use cases or edge cases?
- Would 80% of users ever need this, or just 5%?

**Respect existing patterns**
- If similar features don't have this capability, maybe this one shouldn't either
- Consistency > completeness

**When in doubt, reject**
- It's easier to add a feature later than remove one
- "Not yet" is a valid answer

### Output

Write a `reconciliation.json` file to `@outputDir/@topic/@experiment/`:

```json
{
  "experiment": "@experiment",
  "topic": "@topic",

  "doc_claim": "What the docs literally say (quote it)",
  "actual_behavior": "What actually happens when you test it",
  "tested_with": "The exact mlld code you ran to verify",

  "verdict": "doc-hallucination | genuine-bug | missing-feature | qa-error",
  "verdict_reasoning": "Why you chose this verdict",

  "assessment": {
    "usefulness": 1-5,
    "usefulness_reasoning": "...",
    "consistency_with_mlld": "Does this fit the language design?",
    "workaround": "How can users achieve this today?",
    "implementation_complexity": "trivial | low | medium | high | architectural",
    "recommendation": "implement | defer | reject",
    "recommendation_reasoning": "..."
  },

  "action": "fix-docs | implement | defer | discuss",
  "doc_fix": "If action is fix-docs, what should the docs say instead?",
  "notes": "Any other observations"
}
```

### Assessment Criteria

**implement**: Clear value, fits the design, reasonable to build, no good workaround
**defer**: Potentially useful but not urgent, or needs more design thought
**reject**: Low value, doesn't fit the design, or good workarounds exist → fix docs

### Begin

1. Run `mlld howto @topic` and search for related documentation
2. Test the actual behavior with real mlld scripts
3. Make your assessment with grounded, skeptical judgment
4. Write `reconciliation.json`
