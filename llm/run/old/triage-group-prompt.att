## Work Grouping and Assignment

You are organizing open issues into work assignments for a development sprint.

## Issues to Organize

## Grouping Rules

### Size weights
- **xs** = 0.5 points
- **s** = 1 point
- **m** = 3 points
- **l** = 5 points (always standalone)
- **xl** = 8 points (always standalone)
- **unscoped** = treat as m (3 points) for grouping purposes

### Constraints
1. **L and XL items** are always standalone assignments. If an L/XL is an epic with children, include children in that assignment.
2. **XS, S, and M items** should be grouped by feature area or adjacency. Related fixes that touch the same subsystem belong together.
3. **No group may exceed 5 points total.** A group of 2 m-sized items (6 points) must be split.
4. **Prefer meaningful clusters over arbitrary grouping.** A single m-sized item (3 points) is fine as a standalone assignment if it has no natural neighbors.
5. **Respect dependencies.** If issue A depends on issue B, they should be in the same group (or B should be ranked earlier).

### What makes items "adjacent"
- Same subsystem (grammar, interpreter, CLI, docs, etc.)
- Same feature area (templates, for-loops, imports, etc.)
- Fix the same root cause
- Touch the same files

## Output Format

Respond with ONLY a JSON array (no markdown code fences):

[
  {
    "type": "single",
    "issue_id": "mlld-abc",
    "size": "xl",
    "points": 8,
    "area": "interpreter",
    "rationale": "Large standalone refactor of evaluation pipeline"
  },
  {
    "type": "cluster",
    "area": "grammar-templates",
    "issues": ["mlld-x", "mlld-y", "mlld-z"],
    "points": 2.5,
    "rationale": "Three related template parsing fixes in the same grammar rules"
  }
]

Every issue in the input must appear exactly once in the output (either as a single or within a cluster). Do not drop any issues.
