## Implementation Status Check: @issueId

You are checking whether an issue's requested feature or fix has already been implemented in the codebase.

## Context

**Issue ID**: @issueId
**Type**: @issueType
**Priority**: @issuePriority

### Issue Content

```markdown
@issueContent
```

## Your Task

Search the codebase to determine whether this issue has been partially or fully addressed. Use your tools (Read, Glob, Grep) to examine:

1. **Source code**: Search for implementations matching the issue's described feature or fix
2. **Test cases**: Check if relevant tests exist in tests/cases/ or tests/
3. **Grammar changes**: If grammar-related, check grammar/ files
4. **Documentation**: Check if docs reference the feature as implemented

## Investigation Strategy

- Start by identifying keywords from the issue (feature names, function names, error messages)
- Search for those keywords in source code and tests
- Read relevant files to assess implementation completeness
- Look for partial implementations (code exists but incomplete or buggy)

## Output Format

Respond with ONLY a JSON object (no markdown code fences):

{
  "implementation_score": 0.0-1.0,
  "status": "none|partial|done",
  "evidence": ["src/path/file.ts:123 - implements the described feature", "tests/cases/feature/ - test coverage exists"],
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of what you found",
  "missing": ["what remains unimplemented, if partial"]
}

### Scoring Guide

- **0.0-0.2**: No evidence of implementation. Feature/fix does not exist in code.
- **0.3-0.5**: Partial implementation. Some relevant code exists but the issue is not fully addressed.
- **0.6-0.8**: Mostly implemented. Core functionality exists but minor gaps remain.
- **0.9-1.0**: Fully implemented. The issue's request is addressed in the current codebase.

Be thorough in your search but concise in your output. Cite specific file paths as evidence.
