## Staleness Assessment: @issueId

You are assessing whether an issue/ticket may be stale based on recent project activity.

## Context

**Issue ID**: @issueId
**Created**: @createdDate

### Issue Content

```markdown
@issueContent
```

### Recent CHANGELOG entries

```markdown
@changelog
```

### Git commits since issue was created

```
@commits
```

## Your Task

Assess whether this issue may be stale. Consider:

1. **Design changes**: Has the project's design evolved in ways that conflict with or supersede this issue?
2. **Already implemented**: Was the requested feature/fix already implemented (check CHANGELOG and commits)?
3. **Obsolete context**: Does the issue reference code, patterns, or approaches that no longer exist?
4. **Conflicting decisions**: Have architectural decisions been made that make this issue irrelevant?

## Important Notes

- Issues can be stale even if they were filed recently, if rapid development has changed the landscape
- An issue is NOT stale just because it's old - only if the context has materially changed
- Bug reports are less likely to be stale unless the buggy code was refactored
- Feature requests are more likely to be stale if similar features were implemented differently

## Output Format

Respond with ONLY a JSON object (no markdown code fences):

{
  "staleness_score": 0.0-1.0,
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why this score",
  "evidence": ["specific changelog entry or commit that affects this issue"],
  "recommendation": "keep|review|close"
}

### Scoring Guide

- **0.0-0.2**: Definitely still relevant, no conflicting changes
- **0.3-0.4**: Minor concerns, might need updating but core request is valid
- **0.5-0.6**: Significant context shift, needs review before implementation
- **0.7-0.8**: Likely obsolete, strong evidence of conflicting changes
- **0.9-1.0**: Definitely stale, already implemented or design explicitly rejected

Be conservative - when in doubt, score lower. False positives (marking fresh issues as stale) are worse than false negatives.
