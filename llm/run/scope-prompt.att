## Scope Estimation: @issueId

You are estimating the scope of an issue/ticket for planning purposes.

## Issue Content

```markdown

## Your Task

Provide informal scope estimates for this issue across three dimensions:

### 1. Size (effort)
How much work is this likely to require?
- **xs**: Trivial, < 1 hour. One-liner fix, typo, config change.
- **s**: Small, 1-4 hours. Single file change, straightforward implementation.
- **m**: Medium, 4-16 hours (0.5-2 days). Multiple files, some complexity.
- **l**: Large, 2-5 days. Significant feature, touches many parts of codebase.
- **xl**: Extra large, 1+ weeks. Major feature, architectural changes, new subsystem.

### 2. Complexity (technical difficulty)
How technically challenging is this?
- **xs**: Trivial. Copy existing pattern, no new concepts.
- **s**: Simple. Well-understood problem, clear solution path.
- **m**: Moderate. Some design decisions, a few edge cases.
- **l**: Complex. Multiple interacting systems, tricky edge cases, requires deep understanding.
- **xl**: Very complex. Novel problem, research required, architectural implications.

### 3. Risk (uncertainty/potential for issues)
How likely is this to have unexpected problems?
- **xs**: Minimal risk. Isolated change, well-tested area, easy to verify.
- **s**: Low risk. Mostly isolated, good test coverage exists.
- **m**: Moderate risk. Some dependencies, could affect other features.
- **l**: High risk. Many dependencies, could break things, hard to test fully.
- **xl**: Very high risk. Core system changes, potential data loss, security implications.

## Important Notes

- These are rough estimates for planning, not commitments
- When uncertain, lean toward larger estimates (it's better to over-estimate than under)
- Consider hidden complexity: error handling, edge cases, testing, docs
- Bug fixes are often smaller in size but can be high in complexity/risk
- Features that seem simple often have hidden scope (UI, validation, error states)

### Example Response

{
  "size": "m",
  "complexity": "s",
  "risk": "m",
  "reasoning": "Adding a new CLI flag is straightforward but requires updating docs and tests",
  "key_factors": ["well-defined scope", "existing patterns to follow", "needs test coverage"],
  "potential_blockers": ["may need to coordinate with other pending CLI changes"]
}
