## QA Triage: Select Topics for Testing

You are the triage agent for a QA run of the mlld language project. Your job is to select which topics to test based on available signals.

## Available Topics

All topics with QA tier assignments:

<topics>
@allTopics
</topics>

## Signals

### Git Changes Since Last Run

Files changed since the last QA run:

<git_changes>
@gitChanges
</git_changes>

### Previous Run Failures

Topics that had failures in the most recent run:

<failure_history>
@failureHistory
</failure_history>

### Current Test Status

Fixture test results (passing/failing):

<test_status>
@testStatus
</test_status>

## Your Task

Select topics that maximize value from this QA run. Prioritize:

1. **Changed areas**: Topics covering recently modified code
2. **Regression targets**: Topics that failed previously (verify fixes)
3. **Critical path**: High-priority topics that haven't been tested recently
4. **Breadth**: Don't re-test topics that passed recently unless code changed

## Output

Write your decision to `@outputDir/triage-decision.json`:

```json
{
  "reasoning": "Why these topics were selected",
  "selected_topics": ["topic1", "topic2"],
  "coverage_rationale": {
    "changed_areas": ["topics covering changed code"],
    "regression_targets": ["previously failing topics"],
    "critical_path": ["high-priority topics"]
  }
}
```

Select 10-30 topics per run. Fewer for targeted runs (specific changes), more for broad coverage runs.
