## Before Declaring Anything Blocked

Before writing `blocked.md` or classifying any issue as `major`, you MUST:

1. **Check the intro docs**: Run `mlld howto intro` to understand fundamentals (file formats, `show` directive, basic syntax)
2. **Search broadly**: Run `mlld howto grep <keyword>` for relevant terms - the answer may be in a related topic
3. **Try at least 3 different approaches**: If your first attempt fails, try alternative syntax, different file formats (.mld vs .mld.md), or different directives before concluding something is broken
4. **Check related topics**: Run `mlld howto` to see the full topic list, then check any topics that sound related

If you skip these steps and jump to "this is broken," you will almost certainly be wrong. Most features work - the challenge is finding the right syntax and the right docs.
