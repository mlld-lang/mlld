## Doc Fix: @topics

You are fixing documentation for mlld howto topics based on QA findings.

## Context

**Topics**: @topics
**Description**: @description
**QA directory**: @qaDir

## FIRST: Check for Existing Fix

Before doing any work, check if this doc fix has already been completed:

```bash
cat @qaDir/doc-fix-@stratId.json 2>/dev/null
```

**If the file exists and contains a complete result** (has `atoms_modified` and `verified` fields), then your work is done. Simply confirm the fix looks valid and exit.

**If the file is missing, empty, or incomplete**, proceed with the full fix below.

---

## Your Task

1. Understand what's wrong by reading QA evidence
2. Read the current howto atom(s)
3. Make the documentation fix
4. Verify the fix makes sense

## Investigation

1. Read the trend report for context on this fix:
   ```
   Read @qaDir/trend-report.json
   ```
   Look for entries in `actionable_items` and `feature_health` related to your topics.

2. Read the strategy classification for additional context:
   ```
   Read @qaDir/strategy.json
   ```
   Find the classification whose topics include yours. The `rationale` field explains why this is a doc fix.

3. Check experiment results for specific evidence. For each topic:
   ```
   Glob @qaDir/<topic>/**/results.json
   Glob @qaDir/<topic>/**/self_review.json
   ```
   Read a few failing experiments to understand exactly what confused the QA agent.

4. Read the current atom content. Atoms live in `docs/src/atoms/`. Search for the right file:
   ```
   Glob docs/src/atoms/**/<topic>*.md
   ```

5. Check current behavior:
   ```bash
   mlld howto <topic>
   ```

## Fix Guidelines

- **Only edit atoms** in `docs/src/atoms/` -- never edit `docs/llm/*.txt` directly (those are generated)
- **Be precise**: Fix the specific issue identified, don't rewrite the whole doc
- **Preserve style**: Match the existing documentation tone and formatting
- **Verify examples**: If fixing code examples, test them with `mlld` to confirm they work
- **Add See Also**: If the fix involves missing cross-references, add a `## See Also` section at the end of the atom

## Common Fix Types

### Wrong syntax in examples
Find the incorrect example and replace with tested, working syntax. If the correct syntax is meaningfully different, add a brief note explaining why.

### Missing prerequisite banner
Add a prominent note near the top of the relevant section:
```markdown
> **Requires**: MCP server context. This feature only works when mlld runs as an MCP server.
```

### Missing cross-references
Add a `## See Also` section at the end with links to related topics:
```markdown
## See Also

- [reserved-variables](/docs/howto/reserved-variables) -- built-in variables like `@base`, `@now`
- [methods-builtin](/docs/howto/methods-builtin) -- string and array methods like `.includes()`, `.split()`
```

### Documented-but-unimplemented feature
Add a note marking it as planned. Do NOT remove the description if it provides useful context about the design intent -- just make it clear the feature isn't available yet:
```markdown
> **Planned**: This syntax is not yet implemented. See [roadmap] for status.
```

### Security warnings
Add a clear, prominent warning where users would encounter the behavior:
```markdown
> **Security Note**: Guards only intercept direct `@variable` references, not template-interpolated values. Use direct variable references in guarded operations.
```

## Output

Write a result file to `@qaDir/doc-fix-@stratId.json`:

```json
{
  "strat_id": "@stratId",
  "topics": ["<topic1>", "<topic2>"],
  "atoms_modified": [
    "docs/src/atoms/<category>/<atom>.md"
  ],
  "changes_made": [
    {
      "atom": "docs/src/atoms/<category>/<atom>.md",
      "change": "Brief description of what was changed"
    }
  ],
  "verified": true,
  "timestamp": "<ISO timestamp>"
}
```

## Important

- Do NOT make code changes. This is documentation only.
- Do NOT use git worktrees. Edit files directly on the current branch.
- Do NOT create test fixtures. Doc fixes don't need test coverage.
- Do NOT edit CHANGELOG.md for doc fixes.
- Do NOT edit files in `docs/llm/` -- those are generated from atoms.

## Begin

1. Read trend report and strategy for context
2. Read experiment data to understand the specific failure
3. Read current atom content
4. Make the fix
5. Write the result file
