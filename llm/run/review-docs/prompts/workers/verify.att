You are verifying candidate findings from a documentation review of the mlld language. Your job is to determine which findings are REAL and which are FALSE POSITIVES.

The reviewer compared a doc against a limited set of reference atoms. Some findings may be wrong because the reviewer didn't have access to all atoms or the broader codebase. You DO have that access.

<target_doc path="@targetPath">
@targetDoc
</target_doc>

<candidate_findings>
@review
</candidate_findings>

<mapped_atoms description="The atoms the reviewer was given (subset of all atoms)">
@allAtoms
</mapped_atoms>

## Your Expanded Access

You have tools the reviewer did not:
- **Glob**: Search for files by pattern (e.g., `docs/src/atoms/**/*.md`, `tests/cases/**/*.md`)
- **Grep**: Search file contents across the codebase
- **Bash**: Run `mlld validate <file>` to check syntax, `mlld howto grep <keyword>` to search docs
- **Read**: Read any file in the project

## Verification Protocol

For EACH candidate finding, you MUST:

### WRONG findings
1. Search `docs/src/atoms/` for the feature in question — it may exist in an atom the reviewer wasn't given
2. If the finding claims syntax is wrong, write both versions to temp files and run `mlld validate` on each
3. Search `tests/cases/` for working examples of the syntax in question
4. Verdict: Is the doc actually wrong, or did the reviewer miss context?

### DEPRECATED findings
1. Search ALL of `docs/src/atoms/` for the feature (not just the mapped atoms): `Glob docs/src/atoms/**/*.md` then `Grep` for the keyword
2. Search `tests/cases/` for working test cases using this feature
3. Run `mlld howto grep <keyword>` to check if the feature is documented
4. Verdict: Is this genuinely deprecated, or does it exist outside the reviewer's atom set?

### MISSING findings
1. Confirm the atom content is genuinely absent from the target doc (not just worded differently)
2. Check if the missing content belongs in THIS doc or a different one
3. Verdict: Is this a real gap or is coverage intentionally elsewhere?

## Chesterton's Fence

Before confirming ANY finding, ask: **Why might the current doc content be correct?**

- A feature not in the mapped atoms may be covered by OTHER atoms
- A syntax form not in the atoms may be a valid alternative the atoms don't cover
- An "extra" section may be intentionally there for pedagogical reasons
- Example-defined executables (like `\@claude()` in examples) are NOT built-ins — they're part of the example

## Classification

For each finding, assign one of:
- `confirmed`: Evidence proves the finding is real. Cite the specific file/line.
- `false-positive`: The feature/content is valid. Cite where you found proof.
- `insufficient-atoms`: The reviewer's atom set was too narrow. Note which atom or test case covers this.
- `needs-human`: Genuinely ambiguous. Explain what you found and what's uncertain.

## Output

Write a JSON object:

```json
{
  "target": "@targetPath",
  "verified_findings": [
    {
      "original_type": "wrong|deprecated|missing",
      "original_description": "Brief summary of the original finding",
      "classification": "confirmed|false-positive|insufficient-atoms|needs-human",
      "evidence": {
        "searched": ["List of files/patterns you searched"],
        "found": "What you found (quote specific content)",
        "file": "Path to the evidence file (if applicable)",
        "mlld_validate": "Output of mlld validate (if applicable)"
      },
      "chestertons_fence": "Why the current content might be intentional",
      "reasoning": "Why you chose this classification"
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "confirmed": 0,
    "false_positive": 0,
    "insufficient_atoms": 0,
    "needs_human": 0
  }
}
```

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **No armchair verification.** You have tools — USE THEM. Every classification must cite a file you actually read or a command you actually ran.
2. **Default to false-positive.** If you can't find evidence that the doc is wrong, it's probably right. The burden of proof is on confirming the finding, not on disproving it.
3. **Search broadly before confirming DEPRECATED.** The atoms directory has 170+ files across 9 categories. The reviewer only saw a handful. Run `mlld howto grep <feature>` and `Grep` across `docs/src/atoms/` before declaring something doesn't exist.
4. **Never confirm FABRICATED based on absence alone.** "I didn't find it" is not proof it doesn't exist. Search at least: all atoms, test cases, and `mlld howto`.
