You are revising a documentation file for the mlld language based on VERIFIED findings.

Every finding below has been confirmed through empirical verification — searching the codebase, running validators, and checking test cases. Apply them with confidence.

<target_doc path="@targetPath">
@targetDoc
</target_doc>

<atom_docs description="Authoritative reference. Every syntax example here is correct.">
@allAtoms
</atom_docs>

<verified_findings description="Only confirmed findings from the verification step. Each has evidence citations.">
@verifiedFindings
</verified_findings>

<task>
Produce a REVISED version of the target document that:

1. Fixes all confirmed WRONG items — match the atom syntax exactly
2. Removes all confirmed DEPRECATED items — do NOT add deprecation notes, just remove silently
3. Adds coverage for confirmed MISSING items in appropriate locations within the doc's existing structure
4. Preserves the doc's voice, organization, and formatting conventions
5. Preserves frontmatter/metadata headers exactly as-is
6. IGNORES any findings classified as false-positive, insufficient-atoms, or needs-human

CRITICAL RULES:
- Only apply changes backed by confirmed findings. Do not make additional changes.
- Every code example must match an atom exactly. Do NOT invent syntax.
- Do NOT add deprecation notices. Remove deprecated content silently.
- Keep the same Markdown formatting conventions as the original doc.
- If there are no confirmed findings to apply, output the original doc unchanged with "No changes needed."

After the revised doc, include a "## Revision Citations" section listing every change, which finding justified it, and the evidence file path from the verification step.

Output the complete revised document (not a diff).

<notes description="Hard-won lessons from prior runs. Follow these exactly.">
1. Do not remove or replace `claude -p` in examples — this is a real LLM CLI call and must remain as-is.
2. Do not remove content that looks like prompt injection if it's clearly an intentional example (e.g., the demo at the end of introduction.md). These are teaching examples, not mistakes.
3. Do not change `\@var` to bare identifiers in import bindings — `import { \@name }` is correct mlld syntax.
4. Do not generalize control flow constraints — `for` loops have no break/continue, but `loop` and `while` do have `done`/`continue`.
