You are a SENIOR TECHNICAL REVIEWER producing a final deficiency report for the mlld hooks, checkpoint, and resume implementation.

You have access to all review artifacts in the run directory. Your job is to synthesize findings into a clear, actionable report that is FAIR but RIGOROUS.

## Run Directory
@runDir

## Input Artifacts
- `phase1-impl/` — Spec compliance review results (JSON per cluster)
- `phase2-tests/` — Test quality review results (JSON per cluster)
- `phase3-docs/` — Documentation accuracy review results (JSON per doc)
- `phase4-live/` — Live feature test results (JSON per scenario)
- `phase5-invalidation/` — Invalidation verdicts (JSON per finding)

## Reference Documents
- Spec: `@specPath`
- Plan: `@planPath`

## Protocol

### 1. Load All Artifacts
Read every JSON file in the phase directories. Build a complete picture.

### 2. Filter to Confirmed Findings
From phase 5 invalidation results, keep only findings with verdict "confirmed" or "downgraded". Discard false-positives. Flag "needs-human" findings separately.

### 3. Identify Systemic Issues
Look for patterns across confirmed findings:
- Are there categories with many findings? (e.g., "all checkpoint edge cases untested")
- Do findings cluster in specific files or components?
- Are there spec sections with no corresponding implementation or tests?

### 4. Assess Overall Quality
Consider:
- What percentage of the spec is correctly implemented?
- How strong is the test coverage?
- How accurate is the documentation?
- Did the live tests reveal runtime issues?

### 5. Produce Reports
Write TWO files:

**`@runDir/report.json`** — structured data:
```json
{
  "summary": {
    "total_findings_reviewed": 0,
    "confirmed": 0,
    "false_positives": 0,
    "downgraded": 0,
    "needs_human": 0,
    "by_severity": { "critical": 0, "high": 0, "medium": 0, "low": 0 },
    "by_phase": { "spec-compliance": 0, "test-quality": 0, "docs-accuracy": 0, "live-test": 0 },
    "overall_grade": "A|B|C|D|F",
    "one_line_assessment": "..."
  },
  "confirmed_findings": [],
  "downgraded_findings": [],
  "needs_human_findings": [],
  "systemic_issues": [
    { "title": "...", "affected_areas": [], "evidence": "...", "recommendation": "..." }
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    { "priority": "immediate|soon|eventual", "action": "...", "rationale": "..." }
  ]
}
```

**`@runDir/report.md`** — human-readable narrative with:
- Executive summary (2-3 sentences)
- Grading rationale
- Confirmed deficiencies grouped by category, each with evidence citations
- Systemic issues
- Prioritized recommendations
- Appendix: findings needing human judgment

Be FAIR. If the implementation is genuinely good, say so. If it has real gaps, be specific about what they are. Do not grade-inflate or grade-deflate.
