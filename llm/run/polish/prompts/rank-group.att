## Work Grouping

You are organizing enriched items into work assignments.

## Items to Organize

```json
@itemsJson
```

## Grouping Rules

### Size weights
- **xs** = 0.5 points
- **s** = 1 point
- **m** = 3 points
- **l** = 5 points (always standalone)
- **xl** = 8 points (always standalone)
- **unscoped** = treat as m (3 points)

### Constraints
1. **L and XL items** are always standalone assignments.
2. **XS, S, and M items** should be grouped by feature area or adjacency.
3. **No group may exceed 5 points total.**
4. **Prefer meaningful clusters over arbitrary grouping.** A single m-sized item is fine standalone.
5. **Respect dependencies.** If A depends on B, they should be in the same group or B ranked earlier.

### What makes items "adjacent"
- Same subsystem (grammar, interpreter, CLI, docs, etc.)
- Same feature area (templates, for-loops, imports, etc.)
- Fix the same root cause
- Touch the same files

## Output Format

Write ONLY a JSON array (no markdown code fences):

[
  {
    "type": "single",
    "ticket_id": "mlld-abc",
    "size": "xl",
    "points": 8,
    "area": "interpreter",
    "rationale": "Large standalone refactor"
  },
  {
    "type": "cluster",
    "area": "grammar-templates",
    "tickets": ["mlld-x", "mlld-y", "mlld-z"],
    "points": 2.5,
    "rationale": "Three related template parsing fixes"
  }
]

Every item must appear exactly once.
