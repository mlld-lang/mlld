## Merge Verified Fixes: Batch @batchNum

You are merging verified fixes from worktrees into the main branch.

## Context

**Base branch**: @baseBranch
**Run directory**: @runDir

## Worktrees to Merge

```json
@mergeItemsJson
```

## Instructions

For each item where `verified == true`, merge it into @baseBranch.

Process them **in order** to minimize conflicts.

### For Each Fix

#### 1. Switch to Worktree and Review

```bash
wt switch <worktree_branch>
git log --oneline -3
git diff @baseBranch...HEAD --stat
```

Verify:
- Code changes look correct for the fix
- No unintended files changed

#### 2. Switch Back and Merge

```bash
wt switch @baseBranch
wt merge <worktree_branch>
```

If there are merge conflicts:
- Resolve them carefully
- For code conflicts: prefer the worktree's fix changes
- For CHANGELOG conflicts: include BOTH entries
- After resolving: `git add . && git commit`

#### 3. Record Merge Result

Get the merge commit SHA:
```bash
git rev-parse HEAD
```

#### 4. Do NOT Remove Worktree

Worktree cleanup happens after verification. Leave the worktree intact.

### Skip Conditions

Skip merging an item if:
- `verified == false` (tests didn't pass)
- `merged == true` (already merged)
- The worktree branch no longer exists

### Handling Failures

If a merge fails and cannot be resolved:
1. Abort the merge: `git merge --abort`
2. Record the error
3. Continue with remaining items

## Output

Write to `@outputPath`:

```json
{
  "batch": @batchNum,
  "base_branch": "@baseBranch",
  "results": [
    {
      "ticket_id": "m-xxx",
      "worktree_branch": "polish/m-xxx",
      "merged": true,
      "merge_commit": "<sha>"
    },
    {
      "ticket_id": "m-yyy",
      "worktree_branch": "polish/m-yyy",
      "merged": false,
      "skip_reason": "tests failed"
    }
  ],
  "merged_count": 1,
  "skipped_count": 1,
  "failed_count": 0
}
```
