## Your Task

Provide three assessments for this ticket:

### 1. Staleness Assessment

Is this issue still relevant given recent project activity?

Consider:
- Has the project's design evolved in ways that conflict with or supersede this issue?
- Was the requested feature/fix already implemented (check CHANGELOG and commits)?
- Does the issue reference code, patterns, or approaches that no longer exist?

**Scoring**: 0.0-1.0
- 0.0-0.2: Definitely still relevant
- 0.3-0.4: Minor concerns, might need updating
- 0.5-0.6: Significant context shift, needs review
- 0.7-0.8: Likely obsolete
- 0.9-1.0: Definitely stale

### 2. Implementation Status

Search the codebase to determine if this has been implemented.

Use your tools (Read, Glob, Grep) to check:
- Source code for matching implementations
- Test cases in tests/cases/ or tests/
- Grammar files if grammar-related
- Documentation references

**Scoring**: 0.0-1.0
- 0.0-0.2: No implementation exists
- 0.3-0.5: Partial implementation
- 0.6-0.8: Mostly implemented
- 0.9-1.0: Fully implemented

### 3. Scope Estimation

Estimate the scope across three dimensions:

**Size** (effort):
- xs: < 1 hour, trivial
- s: 1-4 hours, single file
- m: 4-16 hours, multiple files
- l: 2-5 days, significant feature
- xl: 1+ weeks, major feature

**Complexity** (technical difficulty):
- xs: Trivial, copy existing pattern
- s: Simple, clear solution
- m: Moderate, some design decisions
- l: Complex, multiple systems
- xl: Very complex, research required

**Risk** (uncertainty):
- xs: Minimal, isolated change
- s: Low, mostly isolated
- m: Moderate, some dependencies
- l: High, many dependencies
- xl: Very high, core changes

## Output Format

Write ONLY a JSON object (no markdown code fences):

{
  "staleness": {
    "score": 0.2,
    "reasoning": "Issue still relevant, no conflicting changes in CHANGELOG",
    "evidence": []
  },
  "implementation": {
    "score": 0.0,
    "status": "none",
    "reasoning": "No evidence of implementation found",
    "evidence": []
  },
  "scope": {
    "size": "m",
    "complexity": "s",
    "risk": "m",
    "reasoning": "Moderate effort, straightforward implementation"
  },
  "tags_to_add": ["size-m", "complexity-s", "risk-m", "stale-check-2", "impl-none"]
}

The `tags_to_add` array should include:
- `stale-check-N` where N = floor(staleness_score * 10)
- `size-X` where X is the size estimate
- `complexity-X` where X is the complexity estimate
- `risk-X` where X is the risk estimate
- `impl-none`, `impl-partial`, or `impl-done` based on implementation status
