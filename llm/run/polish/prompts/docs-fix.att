## Doc Fix: @ticketId

You are fixing documentation for mlld based on ticket requirements.

## Ticket Details

**Ticket ID**: @ticketId
**Description**: @ticketDescription

## Investigation

1. Read the ticket file for full context:
   ```bash
   cat @base/.tickets/@ticketId.md
   ```

2. Search for relevant documentation atoms. Atoms live in `docs/src/atoms/`:
   ```bash
   ls docs/src/atoms/
   ```

3. Search for specific topics mentioned in the ticket:
   ```bash
   grep -r "<keyword>" docs/src/atoms/
   ```

4. Check current behavior with mlld howto:
   ```bash
   mlld howto <topic>
   ```

## Fix Guidelines

- **Only edit atoms** in `docs/src/atoms/` -- never edit `docs/llm/*.txt` directly (those are generated)
- **Be precise**: Fix the specific issue identified, don't rewrite the whole doc
- **Preserve style**: Match the existing documentation tone and formatting
- **Verify examples**: If fixing code examples, test them with `mlld` to confirm they work
- **Add See Also**: If the fix involves missing cross-references, add a `## See Also` section

## Common Fix Types

### Wrong syntax in examples
Find the incorrect example and replace with tested, working syntax.

### Missing prerequisite banner
Add a prominent note near the top:
```markdown
> **Requires**: MCP server context. This feature only works when mlld runs as an MCP server.
```

### Missing cross-references
Add a `## See Also` section at the end with links to related topics.

### Documented-but-unimplemented feature
Mark as planned:
```markdown
> **Planned**: This syntax is not yet implemented.
```

## Validation

After making changes:

1. Run `mlld howto <affected-topic>` to verify output
2. If examples were changed, run them to confirm they work
3. Check for broken links or references

## Output

Write to `@outputPath`:

```json
{
  "ticket_id": "@ticketId",
  "atoms_modified": ["docs/src/atoms/category/atom.md"],
  "changes_made": [
    {
      "atom": "docs/src/atoms/category/atom.md",
      "change": "Brief description of what was changed"
    }
  ],
  "verified": true,
  "validation_notes": "How the fix was validated"
}
```

## Important

- Do NOT make code changes. This is documentation only.
- Do NOT use git worktrees. Edit files directly on the current branch.
- Do NOT create test fixtures.
- Do NOT edit files in `docs/llm/` -- those are generated from atoms.
