## QA Testing: @topic

You are testing mlld's `@topic` feature through black-box testing.

## Constraints

Use ONLY information available via mlld commands:
- `mlld howto @topic`
- `mlld howto grep <pattern>`
- `mlld howto core-modules`

Do NOT investigate the mlld codebase or search the Internet.

## Your Task

1. Run `mlld howto @topic` to understand the feature
2. Create test experiments in `@outputDir/@topic/`
3. Run `mlld init` once in the feature directory
4. Build 3-5 experiments of increasing complexity (L/M/H)
5. Write `results.json` in each experiment directory

## Directory Structure

```
@outputDir/@topic/
├── mlld-config.json         # Created by `mlld init`
├── 01-L-experiment-name/
│   ├── main.mld             # The experiment
│   └── results.json         # Your findings
├── 02-M-experiment-name/
│   └── ...
└── 03-H-experiment-name/
    └── ...
```

## Issue Categories

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `broken-promise` | Docs say X, behavior is Y |
| `unclear-error` | Error message doesn't help diagnose the problem |
| `unclear-docs` | Missing information or confusing explanation |
| `friction` | Works but feels wrong or unexpected |

## Severity Levels

| Severity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `blocker` | Cannot complete the task at all |
| `major` | Significant workaround required |
| `minor` | Slight friction, easy workaround |
| `enhancement` | Not a bug, improvement idea |

## Results Schema

Each experiment MUST produce a `results.json`:

```json
{
  "experiment": "01-L-basic-usage",
  "topic": "@topic",
  "status": "pass|fail|partial",
  "summary": "One-line description of outcome",
  "issues": [
    {
      "category": "broken-promise|unclear-error|unclear-docs|friction",
      "severity": "blocker|major|minor|enhancement",
      "title": "Brief issue description",
      "input": "What you tried (code or command)",
      "expected": "What should have happened",
      "actual": "What actually happened",
      "recommendation": "Suggested fix (optional)"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Complexity Levels

- **L** (Low): Single feature, straightforward usage from docs
- **M** (Medium): Feature combinations, realistic workflow
- **H** (High): Edge cases, stress testing, complex integration

## For LLM Testing

If testing LLM-related features, use `@mlld/claude` with haiku:

```mlld
import { @haiku } from @mlld/claude
var @response = @haiku("Test prompt")
```

## Success Criteria

Your results.json is valid if:
1. All required fields are present
2. `status` is one of: pass, fail, partial
3. `issues` array exists (can be empty for pass)
4. Each issue has valid category and severity enums

Even passing experiments should note friction or enhancement ideas.

## Begin

Start by running `mlld howto @topic` and create your first experiment.
