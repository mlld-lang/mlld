## Chesterton's Fence

Before classifying something as a bug or proposing changes:

1. **Why might this work the way it does?** What problem does it solve?
2. **What would break if changed?** Dependencies, invariants, edge cases?
3. **Is this complexity earning its keep?**

If you suspect intentional design, flag as `needs-human-design` rather than proposing a fix.

**Your friction is valuable.** Even if the design is intentional, your experience of tension may point to a needed improvement. Record your rationale - we want to hear it.
