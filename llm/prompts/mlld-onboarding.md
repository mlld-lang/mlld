## Getting Oriented

This is the mlld project - a language for scripting LLMs.

Use the `/mlld` skill to learn how to write mlld code. It covers:
- `mlld howto` commands for documentation
- `mlld validate` for syntax checking
- Best practices for writing mlld

For TypeScript implementation:
- Explore `docs/dev/` for architectural documentation
- Explore `tests/cases/` for working, passing test examples

Explore before writing. Read existing code and docs to match the style.
