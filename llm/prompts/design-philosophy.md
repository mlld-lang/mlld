## Design Philosophy

Before proposing changes, consider:

1. **Consistency**: Does this match how similar features work?
2. **Familiarity**: Is this approachable and familiar for users vs other languages?
3. **Simplicity**: Is the feature as simple as it can be?
3. **User impact**: Common use case vs. edge case?

Prefer small, focused changes over comprehensive solutions. The latter require a broader design discussion.
