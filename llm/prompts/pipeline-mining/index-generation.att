# Task: Create Index File for Generated Stages

Create an index.ts file that exports all the generated adversarial stages
for easy importing in tests.

## Output File:

Write to: tests/pipeline/harness/stages/index.ts

## Requirements:

The file should:
1. Import all stage files from the stages/ directory
2. Export all stages as a collection
3. Include a README comment explaining these are adversarial stages

## Example Structure:

```typescript
/**
 * Adversarial pipeline stages that reproduce historical bugs.
 * These stages deliberately exhibit problematic behaviors to test
 * that the harness catches regressions.
 *
 * Generated by: llm/run/mine-pipeline-bugs.mld
 */

export { shellStringifyStage, h_shell_stringify } from './shell-interpolation';
export { structuredUnwrapStage, h_unwrap_fail } from './structured-unwrap';
export { foreachStructuredStage, h_foreach_fail } from './foreach-structured';
export { nestedArrayStage, h_nested_stringify } from './nested-arrays';
export { heredocStage, h_large_variable } from './heredoc';
export { metadataStage, h_metadata_drop } from './metadata';
export { jsonEscapeStage, h_json_escape } from './json-escaping';
```

## Instructions:

1. Use the Glob tool to find all `*.ts` files in `tests/pipeline/harness/stages/` (excluding index.ts itself)
2. Read each file to extract the exported names
3. Generate appropriate export statements
4. Write the file directly using the Write tool to: tests/pipeline/harness/stages/index.ts

IMPORTANT: Write the file, don't just output to chat!
