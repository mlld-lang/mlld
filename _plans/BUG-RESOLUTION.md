# Bug Report: ResolutionService.resolveNodes Fails String Concatenation/Assignment within Loop

## Summary

The `ResolutionService.resolveNodes` method fails to correctly build the `result` string when processing `TextNode`s within its `for...of` loop. Logs confirm that immediately before the concatenation/assignment line (`result = result.concat(node.content)` or `result = node.content`), the `node.content` variable holds the correct string value (e.g., "imported.meld") and has correct character codes. However, logs immediately *after* this line show the `result` variable remains empty (`''`). This causes `resolveNodes` and subsequently `resolveInContext` to return an empty string, leading to downstream "Path cannot be empty" errors.

Crucially, simplifying `resolveNodes` to bypass the loop and process only the first node using direct assignment (`result = contentToAppend`) *does* work correctly for single `TextNode` inputs. This isolates the bug to the interaction within the loop construct itself.

## Affected Components

-   `services/resolution/ResolutionService/ResolutionService.ts` (`resolveNodes` method)
-   All downstream consumers of `resolveNodes`, primarily:
    -   `ResolutionService.resolveInContext`
    -   `ResolutionService.resolveText`
    -   `ImportDirectiveHandler` (via `resolveInContext` -> `resolveNodes`)
    -   `PathDirectiveHandler` (likely via `resolveInContext` -> `resolveText` -> `resolveNodes`)

## Symptoms

-   API integration tests involving `@import` or `@path` directives fail with errors originating from `ResolutionService.resolvePath` complaining "Path cannot be empty".
-   Detailed logging shows:
    -   `resolveInContext` receives the correct path structure or string.
    -   `resolveNodes` is called with the correct `InterpolatableValue` array containing `TextNode`(s).
    -   Logging *inside* the `TextNode` handling block of `resolveNodes` shows `node.content` has the correct value.
    -   Logging *immediately after* `result += node.content;` shows `result` is still `''`.
    -   `resolveNodes` logs that it is returning `''`.
    -   `resolveInContext` logs that it received/is returning `''`.
    -   `resolvePath` logs that it received `''` and fails.

## Example Log Trace (`simple imports` test - Failing Logic)

DEBUG: [ResolutionService.resolvePath] >>> Calling pathService.validatePath with pathString: ''
# ... Test fails with Path cannot be empty ...
```

## Root Cause Hypothesis

The string assignment/concatenation operation (`result = ...`) within the `resolveNodes` loop is failing silently. The cause is highly likely related to the execution context or environment:
- **Build/Transpilation Issue:** The `tsc`/`tsup` process might generate faulty JS specifically for this loop/async combination.
- **Runtime/Environment Anomaly:** A specific bug in Node.js/V8/Vitest affecting string operations within this specific async function/loop context.
- Scope/closure issues seem less likely now that direct assignment works *outside* the loop structure but not reliably *inside*. 
- Hidden characters ruled out by char code logging.
- Specific concatenation method (`+=` vs `.concat`) ruled out.

## Affected Tests

-   `API Integration Tests > Path Handling > should handle path variables with special $PROJECTPATH syntax`
-   `API Integration Tests > Path Handling > should handle path variables with special $. alias syntax`
-   `API Integration Tests > Path Handling > should handle path variables with special $HOMEPATH syntax`
-   `API Integration Tests > Path Handling > should handle path variables with special $~ alias syntax`
-   `API Integration Tests > Import Handling > should handle simple imports`
-   `API Integration Tests > Import Handling > should handle nested imports with proper scope inheritance`
-   `API Integration Tests > Import Handling > should detect circular imports`

## Next Steps

-   Log character codes of `node.content` to rule out hidden characters.
-   Try alternative concatenation methods (`result = result.concat(node.content)`, `result = [result, node.content].join('')`).
-   Temporarily replace the `resolveNodes` body with hardcoded returns / simplified logic.
-   Examine the compiled JavaScript output for `resolveNodes`.
-   Simplify the test environment if possible.
-   Consider if DI mocks for dependencies like `VariableReferenceResolver` within `resolveNodes` could be interfering.

# Bug Report: ResolutionService.resolveNodes Incorrectly Returns Empty String

## Summary

The `ResolutionService.resolveNodes` method fails to correctly concatenate the `content` of `TextNode`s to its internal `result` string. Despite logs confirming `node.content` holds the correct string value (e.g., "imported.meld") immediately before the `result += node.content;` operation, subsequent logs show `result` remains empty, leading to the function returning `''`.

## Affected Components

-   `services/resolution/ResolutionService/ResolutionService.ts` (`resolveNodes` method)
-   All downstream consumers of `resolveNodes`, primarily:
    -   `ResolutionService.resolveInContext`
    -   `ResolutionService.resolveText`
    -   `ImportDirectiveHandler` (via `resolveInContext` -> `resolveNodes`)
    -   `PathDirectiveHandler` (likely via `resolveInContext` -> `resolveText` -> `resolveNodes`)

## Symptoms

-   API integration tests involving `@import` or `@path` directives fail with errors originating from `ResolutionService.resolvePath` complaining "Path cannot be empty".
-   Detailed logging shows:
    -   `resolveInContext` receives the correct path structure or string.
    -   `resolveNodes` is called with the correct `InterpolatableValue` array containing `TextNode`(s).

    -   `resolveNodes` logs that it is returning `''`.
    -   `resolveInContext` logs that it received/is returning `''`.
    -   `resolvePath` logs that it received `''` and fails.

```

## Root Cause Hypothesis

The fundamental string concatenation operation (`result += node.content;`, `result.concat(node.content)`) within the `resolveNodes` loop is failing silently for an unknown reason specific to the test environment or build process. Basic string concatenation should work, and logs confirm:
- `node.content` holds the correct string value.
- Character codes for `node.content` are normal, ruling out hidden characters.
- Using intermediate variables for concatenation does not help.

Potential causes:
- **Build/Transpilation Issue:** The TypeScript-to-JavaScript compilation might be introducing an error specifically in this function's loop/async context.
- **Runtime/Environment Anomaly:** A specific issue with Node.js/V8/Vitest affecting string operations in this context.
- Scope issue with `result` variable (seems less likely).

## Affected Tests

-   `API Integration Tests > Path Handling > should handle path variables with special $PROJECTPATH syntax`
-   `API Integration Tests > Path Handling > should handle path variables with special $. alias syntax`
-   `API Integration Tests > Path Handling > should handle path variables with special $HOMEPATH syntax`
-   `API Integration Tests > Path Handling > should handle path variables with special $~ alias syntax`
-   `API Integration Tests > Import Handling > should handle simple imports`
-   `API Integration Tests > Import Handling > should handle nested imports with proper scope inheritance`
-   `API Integration Tests > Import Handling > should detect circular imports`

## Next Steps

-   Investigate the `result += node.content;` line within `ResolutionService.resolveNodes` further.
-   Try alternative concatenation methods (`result = result.concat(node.content)`, `result = [result, node.content].join('')`).
-   Log character codes of `node.content` to rule out hidden characters.
-   Examine the compiled JavaScript output for `resolveNodes`.
-   Simplify the test environment if possible.
-   Temporarily replace the `resolveNodes` body with hardcoded returns.
-   Consider if DI mocks for dependencies like `VariableReferenceResolver` within `resolveNodes` could be interfering, although the failing path involves only `TextNode`.
